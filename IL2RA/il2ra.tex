\section{Background}

\Glspl{GWAS} have found at least two \glspl{SNP} that associate with T1D in the chr10p14-p15 region, which contains the \gene{IL2RA} gene \citep{Lowe:2007ij}.
\gene{IL2RA} codes for the alpha chain of the trimeric \protein{IL-2} cytokine receptor, also known as \protein{CD25},  
which is found at varying quantities on the surface of numerous T lymphocyte subsets such as naive, memory and
regulatory cells.
\protein{CD25} is also upregulated upon activation in many types of immune cells, including lymphocytes and monocytes, 
and is known to play a key role in immunoregulation and immune responsiveness \citep{Brusko:2009bn,Boyman:2012cy}.
Further fine-mapping of the \gene{IL2RA} region by \citet{Lowe:2007ij}, \cite{Smyth:2008kx} and \cite{Maier:2009hh}, has yielded three SNPs, which lie within
the first noncoding intron of \gene{IL2RA}:
\begin{itemise}
  \item \snp{rs12722495}  
    %juvenile idiopathic athritis
  \item \snp{rs2104286}, also protective for multiple sclerosis \citep{Beecham:2013hh}
  \item \snp{rs11594656}, also protective for rheumatoid arthritis \citep{Stahl:2010dy}
\end{itemise}


To better study the downstream implications of these SNPs on \protein{CD25} expressing T lymphocyte 
%(\Cref{figure:lymphocyte-subsets})
subsets, \citet{Dendrou:2009dv} selected blood samples obtained from healthy donors
chosen by genotype at these SNPs, age and sex from the CambridgeBioresource\footnote{\url{www.cambridgebioresource.org.uk}}.
The experiment consisted of a total of $180$ individuals, sixteen of which were recalled for a second sample (\Cref{table:IL2RA-recalled-individuals}).
%A total of 224 FCS files.
%and split into to seven genotype groups.
The distribution by age ($20$ to $50$ years old) and sex is split evenly across genotype groups.  
The running time of the whole experiment was seven months over which samples were analysed on $51$ days,
between one and eight samples per day (\Cref{figure:IL2RA-sample-time}).  
The samples were stained with the flurochrome-antibody panel in \Cref{table:IL2RA-panel}.

The cell phenotypes studied by \citet{Dendrou:2009dv}, were obtained using manual gating with the FlowJo software\footnote{\url{www.flowjo.com}}.
Manual gating follows the current state of understanding of immune cell lineages (\Cref{figure:manual-gating-strategy}).
Lymphocytes are distinguishable from more granular and larger cell types based on forward and side scatter.
Within the lymphocytes, the subset expressing \protein{CD4} are defined as T lymphocytes.
The CD4+ T lymphocyte subset can be further divided into regulatory and non-regulatory cells (\Cref{figure:manual-gating-strategy}c).
Regulatory cells represent a lower frequency subset which are higher in \protein{CD25} and lower in \protein{CD127}.
Regulatory T cells can be defined more precisely by the intracellular \protein{FOXP3} transcription factor.
Non regulatory T cells represent the bigger proportion of T lymphocytes.
They express more \protein{CD127} and less \protein{CD25} than regulatory T cells.
The non regulatory T cells can be further divided into naive and memory subsets (\Cref{figure:manual-gating-strategy}d).  
Upon antigen presentation, naive cells are activated and differentiate into effector cells, some of which further differentiate into memory cells
while the remainder die.
Thus cells are in a transitional state between naive and memory.  
As part of the transition process from naive to memory, the \protein{CD45RA} is lost so that consequently naive cells are higher in CD45RA than memory cells.
A further secondary distinguishable property is that memory cells tend to be higher in \protein{CD25} expression than naive cells.
Since \protein{CD25} expression on the naive cells is low, \citet{Dendrou:2009dv} define a threshold above which naive cells are deemed positive on CD25.
Their threshold is defined in terms of an isotype control, a sample not stained for \protein{CD25}, to measure the background.
%adjusted depending on the MFI of the blank beads population on that day.
\protein{CD25} is known to be upregulated under inflammatory conditions

\end{figure} 


Since samples were collected and analysed over a period of seven months, 
instrument variation is detectable in the CD25 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the memory cell population (\Cref{figure:memory-CD25MFI-time-effect}).
This time effect was first discussed in \citet{Dendrou:2009bl}.
To correct for this time effect, beads are ran daily in order to define a transform from MFI to molecules of equivalent fluorescence (MEF).
These beads can also be used to define a threshold above which cells are considered positive for \protein{CD25}.
The bead data consists of six populations which are manually gated by \citet{Dendrou:2009dv}.

In the first section of this chapter, I will show how to gate the bead data automatically.
Next I will move on to the harder task of the automatic gating of some of the cell phenotypes studied by \citet{Dendrou:2009dv}.
% Calli's results
% cell phenotypes
Two of these cell phenotypes, percent of CD25 positive naive cells and CD25 MFI of memory cells, were found to be associated with SNPs in the IL2RA.
Percent of CD25 positive naive cells and percent of memory cells, were found to be associated with age and marginally associated with sex.
The repeatability was also tested thanks to the 15 repeated individuals.
Repeatability is important because better repeatability improves our power.
These results as reported by \citet{Dendrou:2009dv} are summarised in \Cref{table:calli-results}.  
In this chapter I will assess, whether I can replicate or improve on these results, with special attention given to repeatability,
by replacing two terminal univariate manual gating steps (\Cref{figure:manual-gating-strategy}d)
with a computational method:
%Manual gating follows a step-by-step hierarchical process.
%Ideally the entire manual gating process should be replaced by an automatic algorithm.
%But in order to facilitate initial comparison with manual gating, in this chapter,
%I will only automate the two last univariate gating steps (\Cref{figure:manual-gating-strategy}d):
\begin{itemise}
\item Univariate gating on \protein{CD25} to threshold naive cells into positive and negative subsets.
\item Univariate gating on \protein{CD45RA} to threshold non-regulatory T cells into naive and memory cells.
\end{itemise}

\section{Univariate clustering of bead data}

In flow cytometry, a method of normalising fluorescence intensity to account for instrument variation, is to convert the \gls{MFI}
measured on a population to \gls{MEF} \citep{Schwartz:1996jj,Dendrou:2009bl}.
In order to apply this conversion, specially designed beads of known and (assumed) constant fluorescence defined in terms of \gls{MEF}, are used as a reference.
The MEF property of these beads is deemed stable whereas the MFI of the bead population is dependent on the instrument and varies over time.

The beads used here are specially manufactured so that they belong to six distinct populations of increasing MEF as shown in \Cref{table:fluorospheres}.
Following the bead manufacturer's guidelines, plotting the $\log_{10}(MEF)$ of these six bead populations against
the corresponding calculated $\log_{10}(MFI)$ from the gated bead populations, we fit the linear regression:

\begin{equation}
    \log_{10}(\text{MEF})=\beta \times \log_{10}(\text{MFI}) + \alpha
\label{equ:MEF}
\end{equation}

The MEF is in fact a power transform of the MFI\footnote{This transform is only defined for strictly positive MFI values}:

\[
    \text{MEF}= 10^\alpha \times \text{MFI}^\beta
\]

The original MEF transform used by \citet{Dendrou:2009bl} assumes that $\beta=1$,
although I relax that assumption.
%which gives similar results given that I found that the $\beta$ term in \Cref{equ:MEF} turns out to be on average $0.96$.

In calculating the slope $\beta$ and the intercept $\alpha$ parameters of the linear model,
only the five brighest bead are used because the MEF of the blank beads is not specified by the manufacturer.
%In fact extrapolating the MEF of the blank beads yields the detection threshold (\Cref{figure:mef}) which we will see in the next section,
However, as we will see in the next section, the blank beads can be used to define a threshold for positivity.
%The MEF of the blank beads is always greater than the intercept $\alpha$  which represents the log offset (the zero channel value).
%Below this threshold the intensity is meaningless as the blank beads contain by design no fluorochrome.

Typically bead data is gated manually.
Here, in order to obtain the parameters of the MEF transform, I will use an automatic process to gate the beads.

Since all beads are manufactured to be of identical dimensions, we expect a single cluster in the scatter channels: the singlet bead population.
Events which lie away from the singlet population are deemed to be beads clumped together or debris and so are discarded.
Filtering of singlets can be achieved by fitting a bivariate normal distribution on forward and side scatter and only keeping the 95th percentile.
Having gated the singlets, I subset the data and proceed to gate on the fluorescence channels to identify the six bead populations.
Given that the number of bead populations is known, that the bead signal is sufficiently clear and that the number of events is small (in the order to 10,000),
I use the K-medoid algorithm (Appendix~\Cref{appendix:clustering}).
The solution has been implemented in the \Rpackage{flowBeads}, available on BioConductor.
Automatic gating shows near perfect agreement with manual gating (\Cref{figure:bead-agreement}) and so is now the established method of analysing
bead data in our lab.
Applying the bead normalisation to the memory CD25 MFI from \Cref{figure:memory-CD25MFI-time-effect}, we improve on the repeatability of that 
cell phenotype from $r^2=0.629$ to $r^2=0.937$ (\Cref{figure:CD25-MFI-beads-normalised}).

\section{Univariate Gating on CD25: defining a CD25 positive threshold on naive cells}

%The population of non regulatory CD4+ T cells is not clearly bimodal on CD25 like CD45RA.
The approach adopted by the manual method is to define a threshold above which cells are considered positive for CD25.
According to \citet{Dendrou:2009bl} and my email correspondence with \contributor{Calliope Dendrou},
the CD25 positive threshold is set manually using an ad-hoc process based on an isotype control and bead data.
An isotype control is a sample stained with the same fluorochrome (APC) but conjugated to a
non-specific sticky antibody not designed to target the marker we are interested in quantifying.
It is used as a technique for assessing APC fluorescence not resulting from CD25 binding.

%adjusted using the daily bead data.
This manual approach to setting the threshold, leads to a different gate position per sample per day (\Cref{figure:cd25pos-gates}).
We notice that on some days there is greater variability in the positions of the gates.
Also, the same downwards time-trend
in the position of the gates which can be explained by
the gates needing to be shifted down to account for this (\Cref{figure:memory-CD25MFI-time-effect}).

\begin{figure} [h]

The black horizontal dashes are the positions of the manual CD25+ gates for all 196 samples over the time course of the experiment (51 days).
The vertical black lines represent the days and so define the range of the manual gate positions on a given day.
The blue line represents our automatic CD25+ gate which corresponds to the $86^{th}$ percentile of the blank bead population.
}
\end{figure}


%As we can see from \Cref{figure:mef}, the Memory T Cell MFI range is in between the MFI of the blank beads and dimmest bead population.
%Our automatic approach relies 
%Thus we define a threshold to distinguish CD25 positive from CD25 negative cells using the automatically gated bead data on the day which the sample was ran.
Drawbacks of the manual approach are its lack of consistency and its reliance on isotype controls.
Isotype controls are costly since part of the sample and fluorochromes is consumed for control purposes, consequently they are not always analysed.
Also they are not necessarily an accurate measure of background fluorescence since
they are also a source of noise linked to differences in the constitution of the control sample,
the behaviour of the staining and other sources of technical variation \citep{Maecker:2006ft}.

I wished to improve on this process by using a more consistent and economical approach, using only beads, which I called \texttt{beads.auto}.
Instead of using isotype data, my working hypothesis,
was that blank beads would constitute a more stable reference, which can be used to define an APC-CD25 threshold.
To find a suitable bead-derived threshold, I first gated the blank beads using my \Rpackage{flowBeads}, then I searched for the APC percentile of the
blank bead population which best agreed with the manual gate (\Cref{figure:cd25pos-gate-agreement}).
I found that in this dataset, the $86^{th}$ percentile of the blank bead population, best matched the manual gate position.

\begin{figure}[h]

{
On the x axis, the CD25 percentiles of the blank bead population from 40 to 99.
On the y axis, the mean squared difference between the position of the manual gate and that of the bead-derived gate.
The $86^{th}$ percentile yields the best agreement with the manual gate positions in terms of mean squared difference.
The automatic threshold selection method (\texttt{beads.auto}) is therefore defined as the APC $86^{th}$ percentile of the blank beads population.

}
\end{figure}

Hence the CD25 positive threshold defined by my approach, \texttt{beads.auto}, is set as the $86^{th}$ percentile of the automatically gated blank bead population on that day.
As we only have one bead set per day, we have a single fixed CD25 gate for all samples on that day (\Cref{figure:memory-CD25MFI-time-effect}).

%In order to assess the dependency of the repeatability on the gates we chose the percentage phenotypes rather than the MEF.
%The concept of repeatability is explained in Appendix~\Cref{repeatability}.
The \texttt{beads.auto} method for setting \protein{CD25} thresholds  shows improved repeatability of the percentage of \protein{CD25}+ naive T cell phenotype
than manual (\Cref{figure:repeatability-cd25pos-naive}).  

Since the dataset contains 15 repeated individuals, I applied linear mixed effects model with random intercept to allow for per individual effect.
Each covariate, genotype, age and sex, was applied in a separate linear regression
(\Cref{table:naive-cd25pos-association}).

\section{Univariate Gating on CD45RA: fitting two-component mixtures on non-regulatory T cells}

Non regulatory CD4+ T cells appear bimodal on CD45RA because this marker is lost upon activation of naive cells (CD45RA+) to memory cells (CD45RA-).
In this section, we will model the CD45RA distribution by fitting a two component mixture model.
Although we model both populations, we will only gate the memory (CD45RA-) cell population, which corresponds to the first component,
since the naive (CD45RA+) cell population, the second component, is not a terminal gate as
it is further divided into CD25 negative (see previous section) and positive subsets.

First, I will try a two univariate Guaussian distributions, then I will try a more flexible mixture of two symmetric distributions.
To this purpose, I used the \Rpackage{mixtools}  which provides an implementation of the \Gls{EM} algorithm \citep{Dempster:1977ul}
to fit Gaussian (\Rfunction{normalmixEM}) but also semi-parametric symmetric distributions (\Rfunction{spEMsymloc}).
%Returns semiparametric EM algorithm output (Bordes et al, 2007, and Benaglia et al, 2009) for location mixtures of univariate data and symmetric component density.
The initial estimate for the parameters of the two mixtures was given by running the K-medoids algorithm (\Cref{appendix:clustering}).
The EM algorithm is then run until convergence to estimate the parameters, mean, variance and component weight for the two Guaussian mixture model.
%Because we are only dealing with a mixture of two distributions only one mixing parameter needs to be estimated since the other is simply its complement.
%The other parameters to be estimated are the parameters of the distribution such as the mean and the variance when fitting a mixture of Gaussians or simply the location parameter
%for the semi-parametric distributions..
%More general distributions which are also symmetric
Semiparametric symmetric distributions are kernel density estimates centered around a location parameter.
The bandwidth parameter of the kernel density estimate is fixed to $0.1$ but could also have been estimated heuristically from the data.

Once the two component mixture has been fitted, I will, in a first instance, attempt to emulate manual gating by defining a threshold.
%later, I will consider using the mixture weights.  
I will consider two approaches of selecting a threshold, \texttt{pct.thresh} and \texttt{post.thresh}, both which are illustrated in \Cref{figure:cd45ra-threshold-example}.

The aim of the first method, \texttt{pct.thresh}, is to closely replicate the manual CD45RA- gating procedure, as explained to me by \contributor{Linda Wicker}.
In this approach, only the shape of the first component of the mixture model influences the position of CD45RA- memory gate.
In order to delineate the memory population, we first identify the first peak of the bimodal CD45RA distribution,
which when a two-component mixture has been fit, should correspond to the peak of the first component.
Then, following the CD45RA density curve from the peak towards the left-hand-side,
we record the CD45RA value after which the density curve drops below a certain given threshold.
This CD45RA value is then mirrored to the right-hand-side of the peak in order to define the CD45RA- threshold.
This technique is in fact equivalent to selecting a fixed percentile threshold
for the first component to gate consistenty across all samples.
%an manual approach to consistently drawing a CD45RA memory gate across all samples 
%is closer to manual gating is to only consider the shape of the memory cell population
%to draw the threshold. Here, a percentile of the first component can be used as cut-off.

The second method, \texttt{post.thresh}, considers the density ratio of both components in order to decide where to draw a threshold.
Formally, \texttt{post.thresh} selects a threshold on the posterior probability of belonging to the first component, the memory population, across all samples.
At a given point, the posterior probability of belonging to the first component is defined as the ratio of the density of the first component,
over that of the total density.
%The posterior probability can be interpreted as the confidence with which an event can be assigned to a component.
Concretely, given a two component mixture model where, $f_1$ is the density of the first component and $f_2$ the density of the second, and a posterior threshold of $p$,
then a point $x$ is assigned to component 1 provided that:
\[
  f_1(x) \geq f_2(x) \dfrac{p}{1-p}
\]
For example, if the posterior probability threshold was $p=95\%$, then for $x$ to be assigned to the first component, $f_1(x)$ would need to be $19$ times larger than $f_2(x)$.

Given these two thresholding approaches, I wish to select a threshold for \texttt{pct.thresh} and for \texttt{post.thresh}, which most closely matches the manual gating.
To this purpose, I use the method described in the previous section (\Cref{figure:cd25pos-gate-agreement}), to find the threshold which minimises the mean square difference with the manual gate position.
Applying this method, I find that the optimal threshold is the $88^{th}$ percentile for \texttt{pct.thresh},
and $89\%$ for \texttt{post.thresh} (\Cref{figure:cd45ra-gate-agreement}).
Also I notice that for the \texttt{post.thresh}, in certain samples,  the posterior probability does reach thresholds beyond $89$ (\Cref{figure:cd45ra-posterior-threshold-fail}).
This can be due to poor model fit (\Cref{figure:cd45ra-posterior-threshold-fail}a) or too much overlap between the memory and naive cell population.

The $86^{th}$ percentile yields the best agreement with the manual gate positions in terms of mean squared difference.
The automatic threshold selection method  is therefore defined as the APC $86^{th}$ percentile of the blank beads population.

{
  Individual d was chosen to illustrate, \texttt{pct.thresh} and \texttt{post.thresh}, because on one day (a and b) to the next (c and d), 
  the CD45RA distribution takes on a very different shape.
  In (a) and (c), the \texttt{pct.thresh} method, places the gate at the 88th percentile of the first component.
  In (b) and (d), the \texttt{post.thresh} method, places the gate where the posterior of the first component reachers 89 percent.
  This poses a problem in (d) because the overlap of the components is such that the posterior is only reached close to zero
  which yields a much smaller gate and consequently a lower percent of memory cells (\Cref{figure:memory-auto-manual-agreement}d).

{
  In black the manual gate.  In red the \texttt{post.thresh} gate drawn at $89$.
  The posterior probability does not reach 99 percent in these six samples.
  In a) this is because of poor model fit.
  In the others a), b), c) and d), this is due to the mixing of the two distributions.
  In b) the green distribution, component 2, is much wider which causes the density to be higher giving
  rise to this non-uniform decreasing posterior function.
}
\end{figure}


Using both approaches, the agreement with manual of the memory CD25 MFI is good (\Cref{figure:memory-auto-manual-agreement}).
This is to be expected as this cell phenotype is not very sensitive to the position of the \protein{CD45RA} gate
(\Cref{figure:cd45raneg-memory-cd25mfi}).  
Hence, for this cell phenotype, this translates to similar repeatability to that obtained with manual gating (\Cref{table:repeatability-memory-cell-MEF-phenotype}) and similar effect sizes (\Cref{table:memory-cell-mef-effect}).
On the other hand, the repeatability of the percentage of memory cell phenotype is very sensitive to the gate position.

\end{table}

We can see that both automatic mixture model approaches (\texttt{mm} and \texttt{sp.mm}) yield worse repeatability than manual (\Cref{figure:repeatability-memory}).
As is the case for the sample from individual d on day one (\Cref{figure:mm-memory}),
the repeatability is compromised when the mixture of distributions approach fails to find a suitable gate because of poor model fit.
If the posterior is used as a cut-off then this could be because the posterior is never reached.
%As the same individual shows a very different profile on day two, I believe that, in this case, the noise is due to technical variation on that day rather
%than true biological variation.
%\subsection{Improved Repeatability when Averaging Gate Positions}
One reason why the manual gates on that day are more appropriate is because a human uses prior knowledge obtained from other samples of where the gates should lie.
This motivates borrowing information from other samples.
A first attempt at learning from other samples (\texttt{learned.mm}) is to compute the mean of the position of the CD45RA gates defined by the \texttt{mm}
method across all samples from the same day excluding the outlying sample from individual d on day one.
Similar to the threshold method for \protein{CD25}+ covered in the previous section, we now have a fixed gate for all samples analysed on the same day.
The \texttt{learned.mm} agreement with manual is improved over \texttt{mm} but not as good as \texttt{sp.mm}.
%but this time requires estimation of gate position by mm followed by averaging their position.
%When attempting to gate more noisy samples, a manual gater will maybe use other samples as a reference.
%One way of better gating is to use prior knowledge from other samples from the same day where the repeatability is good.
Since the gate position is less sensitive to outlier samples, \texttt{learned.mm} improves overall repeatability (\Cref{figure:repeatability-memory-learned}) compared to
\texttt{mm}.
Nonetheless, manual still achieves higher repeatability (\Cref{table:repeatability-results}) as
the gater has prior knowledge of cell population frequencies when dealing with outliers.
As we can see from the association tests of genotype, age and sex with percentage of memory cells \Cref{table:memory-cell-pct-effect},
association is detected with the manually gated cell phenotype for \snp{rs12722495}, age and sex effects,
whereas with the automatic gating, association is not always found.

Semi-parametric mixtures (\texttt{sp.mm}) yields better repeatability than Gaussian mixture model (\texttt{mm}) but individual d remains a clear outlier (a).
The mixture model approach failed to return a sensible gate position for individual d on day one because the data does not fit the two component Gaussian mixture model (c).
The \texttt{learned.mm} approach improves on repeatability by more sensible gating on the outlier sample (b).

\section{Discussion}

%A more real challenge however is to do with the nature of flow data.
%Noise or unexplained variation is inherent to all technologies and the signal to noise ratio in flow cytometry can vary greatly depending on the sample,
%the experimental protocol and the instrument.
%Even when running a "clean" sample such as beads which are manufactured to be identical on a well calibrated instrument the signal to noise ratio of the resulting bead populations is never greater than 30.
%In biological samples the level of noise is much higher and so is the number of outliers which contribute to confusing automatic methods,
%especially when in most cases the number of clusters is unknown and needs to be estimated from the ratio of explained to unexplained variance in the data.
%Many clustering solutions have been suggested as part of the Bioconductor suite of packages which adopt different approaches to trying to solve this problem.
%But remains the problem of how to benchmark these various solutions: comparison to manual gating, correlation with clinical outcome?
%One criteria we have suggested and tested is that of repeatability of results derived from stable features in samples from the same healthy individual recalled up to 7 months later. (Spidlen et al., 2010).
%
In this chapter, I have shown that bead data is readily gated by automatic methods and that the results are comparable to manual gating.
Automatic gating of bead data is fast and automates other related tasks such as MFI to MEF transformation, and threshold selection.
%and reporting of instrument properties such as the detection threshold or the signal-to-noise ratio (or coefficient of variation).

Gating of biological data is more difficult as we have little prior knowledge of the sample we are analysing.
So far, I have developed two automatic univariate gating strategies:
\begin{itemise}
\item a bead defined threshold method on \protein{CD25} to identify CD25+ naive cells
\item a two component mixture model on \protein{CD45RA} to identify memory cells (CD45RA-)
\end{itemise}

My \protein{CD25} univariate gating method (\texttt{beads.auto}) relies on defining a threshold based on automatically gated bead data.
The percentage of naive \protein{CD25}+ cells phenotype identified with my approach showed better repeatability than manual (\Cref{figure:repeatability-cd25pos-naive}).
My approach defines one threshold for all samples gated on the same day,
%which seems appropriate given the blank bead population yields the detection threshold of the instrument on that day.
whereas the manual approach, relies on isotype controls and allows for different thresholds per day.
Isotype controls should theoretically be an estimate of background but have been criticised for being an extra source of noise \citep{OGorman:1999vd}.

My \protein{CD45RA} univariate gating method fits a specific model to the data: a mixture of two univariate distributions.
The parameters of these distributions are estimated using an \Gls{EM} algorithm \citep{Dempster:1977ul}.
In order to emulate manual gating, the gates are defined as a threshold.
The threshold can be defined in terms of posterior probability or responsibility (\SI{95}{\percent})
or in terms of percentile of the first distribution.
%In the future it may be interesting to use all cells and average over the posterior probabilities.
However, if the model does not fit the data then it is unlikely that the position of the gate will be sensible,
which may give rise to outliers.

I used two benchmarks to evaluate my univariate gating strategies: repeatability and comparison of the effects sizes obtained 
by \citet{Dendrou:2009dv} using manual.

Repeatability is an independent measure which does not require comparison to other gating methods (such as manual).
Unfortunately, given that in our data set only 15 samples are repeated, it is difficult to evaluate methods on such a small sample size.
Moreover, good repeatability does not necessarily imply that the gating is unbiased but rather that the gating is consistent.
Hence repeatability, needs to be complemented with some metric, in the form of manual gating or some prior biological knowledge,
to assess whether the computed cell phenotypes are in a sensible range.

We have seen how the difference in the identification of cell phenotypes by different gating methods greatly influences the estimated effect sizes in association studies.
In particular, outliers have an important influence depending on their leverage.
For example when testing association with age, outlier cell phenotypes from younger or older individuals have more leverage than ones closer to the mean.

%\paragraph{Outlier Detection Metric}
Hence, if we are to deploy automatic gating techniques more generally, detection of outliers is crucial.
In particular, we require outlier detection metrics which do not only rely on the availability of repeated samples or manual gates.
For example, one metric of evaluating how well a model fits the data could be a cost function like the Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE).
I will expound on other outlier metrics in later chapters.

When outliers have been detected, we may want to exclude or down-weight them, or extend our gating method to account for these.
One simple way of modifying the method, is to use the gate positions in non-outlier samples to influence those in outliers.
%This clearly rests on the assumption that in the majority of samples, the position of the gate is correct.
I tried this approach with \texttt{learned.mm} by averaging gates on non-outlier samples and applying these to the outlier samples.
%thus exploiting day effects
A more formal approach could be to extend this by using some outlier metric to define weights so that \texttt{learned.mm} leans more heavily
towards samples where the model fits better.
%We have seen that one way of improving overall gating is to allow for the gate positions on well-gated samples to influence those of badly-gated ones.
Clearly, the implicit assumption with \texttt{learned.mmm} is that there are enough well-gated samples to positively influence the gate position of the ill-gated ones
and that the gates in outlier samples should be in about the same position since the sample is noisy but not fundamentally different.
However, one may argue that this approach, conceals rather than addresses the underlying problem of poor model fit.
For example as we see from the trimodal distribution in \Cref{figure:mm-memory}), it may be more appropriate to fit a three component instead
of two component mixture model on this sample.

%\paragraph{Discovering New Subsets of Interest with Automatic Methods}
%So far in this chapter, I have only considered the cell phenotypes defined by \citet{Dendrou:2009dv}.
%In general, these cell populations may not necessarily represent true clusters but are established cells of interest within the field of immunology
%which are known to express \protein{CD25} and hence hypothesised to associate with \gene{IL2RA} SNPs.
%Potentially, there might exist other \protein{CD25} cell phenotypes than the ones under study which also correlate well with these SNPs.
%These might only be separable in higher dimensional space.
%These could be identifiable using unsupervised methods which find clusters in one or more dimensions when the number of clusters is unknown.
%Similar work has been undertaken by \citet{Aghaeepour:2012fq} in identifiying novel subsets which correlate with a clinical outcome in HIV patients.
%Fealect (?) is a method of choosing features of these cells subsets which best correlate with the response variable.

%\paragraph{An Internal Automatic Pipeline}

So far, MFI to MEF using beads has been automated but there are still many parts of the process which can be automated.
In later chapters, I will develop a modular pipeline to further automate the analysis of flow cytometry data generated by our lab.
It will be possible to plug in different types of transformations and gating strategies and see how this influences
the results of the analysis.
This should encourage the wider use of automatic analysis methods for flow data within our lab.


%The pipeline will be configurable to so account for the wealth Obviously the type of analysis will be dependent on the experiment but it may be possible 
%One of the reasons for this is simply that the analysis requirements for different types of flow experiments are so varied that it is difficult to design a solution which will service all needs.

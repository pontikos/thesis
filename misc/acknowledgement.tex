 I am very grateful for having been offered the great opportunity to undertake this PhD and to learn so much about statistics,
 genetics, and science in general.

%And lastly my eternal gratitude to my Mother for instilling in me the love of science.
 First and foremost, my eternal gratitude to my Mother for having devoted so much time to my upbringing and to have kindled my enthusiasm for science
 and adventure from a very young age.
 Although she is sadly no longer among us to know,
 she is also the reason why I decided to dedicate my computer science and programming skills to medical research.

 Secondly, I wish to thank all the great people I have had the privilege to know and work with during this academic adventure.
 %Firstly for trusting my capabilities,
 In particular my super-hero supervisor, Chris Wallace, for her advice, support, and encouragement when I was feeling down, and her pragmatism, guidance,
 and helping me channel my enthusiasm productively when it was overflowing.
 %I am continuously amazed at how 
%It was wonderful having an advisor who had spent many years thinking deeply about the business of modeling, who also allowed me the freedom to make my own mistakes.
 I'd also like to thank my advisor, Anna Petrunkina Harrison, for providing much encouragement and support,
 and putting me in touch with the right people in flow cytometry.
 John Todd's presence and input have been incredibly valuable and I would like to thank him for his relentless drive, insight, experience
 and pushing me to publish.

 Having no formal training in statistics,
 I was privileged enough to be surrounded by smart people throughout my PhD from whom I have learned a lot.
 Notably, Xin Yang, Hui Guo, Nick Cooper, Marina Evangelou and Mary Fortune spring to mind, with whom I have had many interesting lunchtime conversations.
 Mary Fortune's  mathematical genius is only rivalled by here baking skills.
 Xin Yang also makes delicious chinese buns!

 Having also very little prior knowledge in immunology, Marcin Pekalski, Tony Cutler, Xaquin Dopico Castro, Ricardo Fereirra, were very helpful in their explanations.
 They were also very important in making me feel welcome to the lab.
 I wish them all the best in their future endeavours and we will be in touch for scientific reasons or otherwise.

 Vincent Plagnol and Calliope Dendrou for helping me out on the second chapter.
 And special thanks to Vincent for offering me a postdoc at UCL!

 Helen Schuilenberg, Debbie Smyth, James Traherne and Jyothi for helping out on KIR.

 However, no PhD would be complete without a little bit of non-academic adventure which surely should be the object of another thesis.
 My thanks to my team mates Sriyal Mendis and Gary Low for helping me out on my autorickshaw Indian chapter.
 Their driving skills kept me alive and unscathed during our 4000km autorickshaw adventure across India,
 in spite of my unfortunate cowlision in Ongole.

 Thanks to Ben Silva-Weatherley, Steve Sawiak, and the rest of the team at RNA Crossfit for making
 sure I didn't neglect my body through the daily PhD grind.
 Staying true to the humanist ideal of a healthy mind in a healthy body ``mens sana in corpore sans''

 I would also like thank to all the good friends (in particular Shawn O'Donell), students and professionals, I have made during these five fun years at Cambridge,
 first at the European Bioinformatics Institute, then at the University and Addenbrookes.
 Thanks to all housemates of 386 Cherry Hinton Road, past and present, my home of five years.
 Thank you Cambridge for being such a friendly, unique and quircky place which I have grown very fond of.

 Lastly and most importantly, my everlasting gratitude to my Father and my Brother, inspirations in their own right, for their love, incessant support and for listening.

I am very grateful for having been offered the opportunity to undertake this PhD and learn much about statistics and genetics,
and science in general.
Firstly I'd like to thank my supervisor, Chris Wallace, for her pragmatism, optimism and guidance.
Firstly for trusting my capabilities,
further for her advice, encouragement when I was feeling down and helping me channel
my enthusiasm productively when it was overflowing.
%It was wonderful having an advisor who had spent many years thinking deeply about the business of modeling, who also allowed me the freedom to make my own mistakes.
I'd also like to thank my advisor, Anna Petrunkina Harrison, for providing much encouragement and support.
and putting me in touch with the right flow cytometry people.
I'd like to thank John Todd for kicking my ass until I published.

Having no formal training in statistics,
I was privileged enough to be surrounded by smart people throughout my PhD from whom I have learned a lot.
In particular, Xin Yang, Hui Guo, Nick Cooper and Mary Fortune spring to mind, with whom I have had many interesting conversations.
Mary Fortune baking skills are only equalled by her mathematical genius.
Xin Yang also makes delicious chinese buns!

Having also very little prior knowledge in immunology, Marcin Pekalski, Tony Cutler, Xaquin Dopico Castro, Ricardo, were very helpful in his explanations.

Vincent Plagnol and Calliope Dendrou for helping out on my first project.
And Vinent for giving me a place to go to!

James Traherne for helping out on KIR.

Thanks to Sriyal Mendis and Gary Low' driving skills that kept me alive during our 4000km autorickshaw adventure across India,
Sadly I was not able to return the favour my avoiding that cowlision.

Thanks to Ben Weatherley from RNA Crossfit (there is no escaping biology, even at the gym) and Steve Sawiak for pushing me physically.
Staying true to the humanist ideal of a healthy mind in a healthy body ``mens sana in corpore sans''

I am very grateful for having been offered the opportunity to undertake this PhD and learn much about statistics and genetics,
and science in general.
%Firstly for trusting my capabilities,
Firstly I'd like to thank my supervisor, Chris Wallace, for her advice, support,
and encouragement when I was feeling down,
and her pragmatism, guidance,
and helping me channel my enthusiasm productively when it was overflowing.
%It was wonderful having an advisor who had spent many years thinking deeply about the business of modeling, who also allowed me the freedom to make my own mistakes.
I'd also like to thank my advisor, Anna Petrunkina Harrison, for providing much encouragement and support.
and putting me in touch with the right people in flow cytometry.
I'd like to thank John Todd for his insight, experience and kicking my ass until I published.

Having no formal training in statistics,
I was privileged enough to be surrounded by smart people throughout my PhD from whom I have learned a lot.
In particular, Xin Yang, Hui Guo, Nick Cooper and Mary Fortune spring to mind, with whom I have had many interesting lunchtime conversations.
Mary Fortune baking skills are only equalled by her mathematical genius.
Xin Yang also makes delicious chinese buns!

Having also very little prior knowledge in immunology, Marcin Pekalski, Tony Cutler, Xaquin Dopico Castro, Ricardo, were very helpful in their explanations.

Vincent Plagnol and Calliope Dendrou for helping me out on the second chapter.

Helen Schuilenberg, Debbie Smyth, James Traherne and Shruti for helping out on KIR.

Thanks to Sriyal Mendis and Gary Low' for helping me out on my autorickshaw Indian chapter.
Their driving skills kept me alive during our 4000km autorickshaw adventure across India,
Sadly I was not able to return the favour my avoiding that cowlision.

Thanks to Ben Weatherley from RNA Crossfit (there is no escaping biology, even at the gym) and Steve Sawiak for pushing me physically.
Staying true to the humanist ideal of a healthy mind in a healthy body ``mens sana in corpore sans''

Thanks to all the good friends I have made during these five fun years at Cambridge, first at the European Bioinformatics Institute,
then at the university of Cambridge.
Thanks to all housemates of 386 Cherry Hinton Road, past and present, my home of five years.

Thank you Cambridge for being such a unique and quircky place which I have grown very fond of.

And lastly my eternal gratitude to my Mother for instilling in me the love of science.
My brother and my father literary inspiriations in their own right.

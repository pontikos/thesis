abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is caused by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells resulting in insulin deficiency, consequent hyperglycaemia and a tendency to develop ketoacidosis. The autoimmune aetiology is supported by the presence of autoantibodies specific for pancreatic antigens in the serum of patients with the condition, infiltration of islets with T cells and macrophages (`insulitis') and a strong association with specific HLA class II genotypes. The incidence of type 1 diabetes is rising, particularly in the very young. The triggers for this are poorly understood, but there appears to be an interaction between genetic susceptibility and changing environmental factors. It is increasingly recognized that type 1 diabetes can present at any age, but onset in adulthood is associated with a less aggressive disease course and fewer autoimmune markers. The form termed `latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood' may be clinically indistinguishable from type 2 diabetes at the time of diagnosis, but patients typically need to commence insulin therapy within a few years.},

abstract = {The identification of causative genes for the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes (T1D) in humans and candidate genes in the NOD mouse has made significant progress in recent years. In addition to sharing structural aspects of the MHC class II molecules that confer susceptibility or resistance to T1D, genes and pathways contributing to autoimmune pathogenesis are held in common by the two species. There are data demonstrating a similar need to establish central tolerance to insulin. Gene variants for the interacting molecules IL2 and CD25, members of a pathway that is essential for immune homeostasis, are present in mice and humans, respectively. Variation of two molecules that negatively regulate T cells, CTLA-4 and the tyrosine phosphatase LYP/PEP, are associated with susceptibility to human and NOD T1D. These observations underscore the value of the NOD mouse model for mechanistic studies on human T1D-associated molecular and cellular pathways.},

abstract = {Insulin-dependent diabetes is caused by the loss of insulin-producing beta cells in pancreatic islets. It has been proposed that aberrant expression of Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules on beta cells stimulates an autoimmune attack against beta cell antigens. To test this hypothesis, we generated transgenic mice that express Class II MHC molecules (E$\alpha$d/E$\beta$b, or I-Eb) on beta cells. Diabetes was found in 100% of transgenic progeny from three expressing transgenic mouse lines, but without evidence for lymphocytic infiltrates. Furthermore, T lymphocytes appeared to be tolerant to the transgene I-Eb molecule, despite the absence of expression of I-Eb in the thymus or any other lymphoid tissue. The results suggest that novel expression of Class II MHC molecules on nonlymphoid cells is by itself insufficient to initiate autoimmune responses against tissue-specific antigens.},

abstract = {Associations between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility and polymorphism in multiple immunoregulatory genes suggest a role of altered T cell function in the disease. The growing relevance of the oxidative stress in RA synovitis, which results in a number of T cell signalling abnormalities, is reinforced by the demonstration of a direct NO inducing activity through the shared epitope of the HLA class II molecules HLA-DR$\beta$1, with secondary lymphocytes oxidative damage. Direct T cell/macrophage contact-dependent activation, one of the driving mechanisms of synovitis, is mediated by co-stimulatory molecules as well as cell membrane cytokines and may also result in an impaired suppressive function of T regulatory cells (Treg) in RA joints. The fusion of CTLA4 extracellular binding domain to the Fc$\gamma$1 allows to obtain a soluble CTLA4 receptor, the dimeric recombinant human fusion protein abatacept (CTLA4-Ig). The improved knowledge of the CTLA4-B7 co-stimulation regulatory mechanisms by signals delivered into DCs and Tregs provides multiple potential targets for the abatacept treatment. CTLA4-Ig shows the capacity, either ex vivo or in vivo, to interrupt at multiple steps the ongoing inflammatory and destructive process, and to concur in restoring the immunoregulatory balance in RA.},

abstract = {NOD mice spontaneously develop anti-insulin autoantibodies associated with the subsequent development of diabetes. NOD mice that express insulin autoantibodies at 8 weeks of age have a diabetes risk exceeding 90%, while mice that do not express autoantibodies by 16 weeks have a risk of less than 20%. NOD female mice expressed insulin autoantibodies more often than male mice (13/15+vs. 6/15+). Autoantibodies characteristically developed between 8 and 20 weeks and then for most mice became negative at diabetes onset in NOD mice. In the diabetes-free strain NOR mice, spontaneous expression of insulin autoantibodies was observed in less mice (female 8/15+, male 3/10+) compared to NOD mice. The expression of autoantibodies was transient in NOR mice and followed the same time-course as for NOD mice and they were all negative by 28 weeks (without progression to diabetes). No correlation was found in NOR mice between the levels of autoantibodies and insulitis. The program of insulin autoantibody expression is regulated over approximately 5 months for both NOD and NOR mice with only NOD mice developing diabetes, indicating that depending upon genetic combination, the presence of insulin autoantibodies does not always predict diabetes development. In addition, this data is not consistent with the hypothesis that the time-course of autoantibodies simply reflects the destruction of $\beta$-cells with development of diabetes.},

abstract = {Progress has been made in investigating the genetic factors involved in type 1 diabetes (T1D) development for the past few years. While Linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping has been useful for both the confirmation and fine-mapping of susceptibility intervals, as well as identification of etiological mutations, identification of specific disease genes has been a challenge and limited to known candidate genes. The overall risk for T1D from the HLA DR and DQ molecules (IDDM1) is determined by combinations of polymorphic alleles. Functional studies indicate that the susceptible and protective HLA-DR and -DQ bind and present non-overlapping peptides. Although consistent linkage evidence was reported for the susceptibility intervals IDDM2, IDDM5 and IDDM12, evidence for most other intervals varies in different data sets. The variable number of tandem repeats at the 5′ end of the insulin gene (IDDM2) regulates insulin expression in the thymus. Studies on IDDM5 have led to the discovery of a novel polymorphism 163 A{\&}{\#}xa0;→{\&}{\#}xa0;G (M55V) in SUMO4 gene, which was found to be associated with T1D patients with Asian origin. Functionally SUMO4 conjugates to IkB$\alpha$ and negatively regulates NFkB transcriptional pathway. The M55V substitution reduces the sumoylation activity of the V55 variant, which resulted in higher NFkB dependent transcriptional activity. The polymorphisms of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 gene (CTLA4, IDDM12) encoding a regulatory molecule in the immune system associate with T1D and autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATD). The 3′ untranslated region of this gene determines the level of soluble CTLA-4. Genetic mapping of variants conferring a small disease risk can identify pathways in complex disorders, as evidenced by quantitative alterations of candidate genes contributing to autoimmune tissue destruction. Moreover, the identification of two transcription factors that, when mutated, are responsible for severe autoimmune disease is leading to a better understanding of T cell tolerance. Both AIRE and Foxp3, identified initially via their association with genetically manipulated mice, are involved in tolerance induction in humans. Although mutations in these genes may cause rare but serious diseases, it is likely that other transcription factors will contribute to the genetic load that predisposes certain individuals to disease.},

abstract = {The incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and other GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to cause both antiapoptotic as well as regenerative effects on beta-cells in different animal models for diabetes. Our aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that spontaneously diabetic non obese diabetic (NOD) mice show an altered expression of GLP-1 compared to normoglycemic age-matched controls as a consequence of a diabetic state. To do this we used an ELISA prototype for mouse GLP-1 to measure plasma total GLP-1 from recently diabetic NOD mice as well as from age-matched normoglycemic NOD mice (controls). We also stained sections of pancreatic glands for GLP-1 from diabetic NOD mice and controls. We found increased levels of plasma total GLP-1 in diabetic NOD mice, when compared to control mice, both from non-fasted mice and from mice fasted for 2{\&}{\#}xa0;h. Furthermore, diabetic NOD mice displayed a higher GLP-1 response to an oral glucose tolerance test, compared to control mice. We also found that sections of pancreatic glands from diabetic NOD mice had an increased GLP-1 positive islet area in regard to relative islet area (i.e. total islet area / total pancreas area of the sections) compared to control mice. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show increased levels of GLP-1 in plasma in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice. We suggest that these results might represent a compensatory mechanism of the diabetic NOD mice to counteract beta-cell loss and hyperglycemia.},

abstract = {Recently, association of celiac disease with common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants in an extensive linkage-disequilibrium block of 480 kb containing the KIAA1109, Tenr, IL2, and IL21 genes has been demonstrated in three independent populations (rs6822844 Pcombined=1.3×10−14). The KIAA1109/Tenr/IL2/IL21 block corresponds to the Idd3 locus in the nonobese diabetic mouse model of type 1 diabetes (T1D). This block was recently found to be associated with T1D in a genomewide association study, although this finding lacks unequivocal confirmation. We therefore aimed to investigate whether the KIAA1109/Tenr/IL2/IL21 region is involved in susceptibility to multiple autoimmune diseases. We tested SNP rs6822844 for association with disease in 350 T1D-affected and 1,047 rheumatoid arthritis (RA)--affected Dutch patients and in 929 controls. We replicated the association with T1D (P=.0006; OR 0.64 [95% CI 0.50--0.83]), and revealed a similar novel association with RA (P=.0002; OR 0.72 [95% CI 0.61--0.86]). Our results replicate and extend the association found in the KIAA1109/Tenr/IL2/IL21 gene region with autoimmune diseases, implying that this locus is a general risk factor for multiple autoimmune diseases.},

abstract = {The NOD mouse is studied as an animal model of human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). To evaluate the role of IFN$\gamma$ in the pathogenesis of the disease, we have studied the effect of anti-IFN$\gamma$ mAb on the expression of insulitis and clinical diabetes. Treatment of mice with manti-IFN$\gamma$ mAb prevented the induction of early IDDM by cyclophosphamide as well as the adoptive transfer of diabetes by spleen cells from diabetic NOD mice. The protection against induction of diabetes by cyclophosphamide was observed in animals treated with the anti-IFN$\gamma$ mAb within 24 h following the first cyclophosphamide injection but not in animals in which mAb treatment was started 7 days later. Transfer of disease was prevented both in adult irradiated and in newborn recipients. The absence of clinical signs in these mice was corroborated by a significant reduction of both the extent and severity of insulitis. Over-expression of Ia antigen on endothelial cells lining the islets was also considerably reduced in mice treated with mAb. These data strongly suggest a role for IFN$\gamma$ during the autoimmune process leading to $\beta$ cell destruction in diabetes and prompt further investigation of the use of such antibodies in the immunoprevention of IDDM.},

Here we present evidence indicating that injection of the same vaccine at time of early diabetes onset could ameliorate the disease with efficacy, with 42% of mice overtly diabetic by 40 weeks of age compared to 92% in control groups. In addition, immunological analysis revealed that the DNA vaccine induced CD4+CD25+ T cells cultured from draining lymph nodes that had immunosuppressive function in vitro. The induced regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressed the foxp3 gene and showed cell-contact-dependent as well as TGF-$\beta$- and IL-10-independent immunosuppressive activity. Data also revealed that CD4+CD25− T cells from mice immunized with the DNA vaccine yielded a cell population that was foxp3+, showed increased expression of CD25 compared to control, and had immunosuppressive function in vitro, indicating that Tregs could have developed from antigen-induced, peripheral T lymphocytes. In contrast, injection of DNA coding for SGAD55 or BAX alone did not induce Tregs. Altogether, our data confirm that pro-apoptotic DNA vaccination can be used as an immunosuppressive strategy and demonstrate its potential for therapy of pathological autoimmunity.},

abstract = {Several data suggest that stochastic rearrangements of the TCR could play a pathogenic role in both disease predisposition and protection in type 1 diabetes (T1D). As twin sets offer an enormous potential in evaluating the role of genetic and environmental factors in susceptibility to disease, the main goal of this study was to assess whether the degree of sharing of the expressed TCR repertoire of twin pairs discordant for T1D differs from that of disease concordant pairs. We performed our analysis in 5 pairs of monozygotic twins, 3 of which were concordant and 2 discordant for T1D, by combining flow cytometry and CDR3 spectratyping on both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Our data show that TCR repertoires show increased level of concordance within each twin pair, especially in CD8+ cells, in terms of mean BV expression levels on flow cytometry as well as of CDR3 patterns and frequencies of skewed or oligoclonal BV subfamilies on spectratyping. It is worth noting that the degree of similarity among twins seems to be independent of concordance or discordance for T1D. Our findings seem to suggest that in monozygotic twins with T1D the TCR repertoire is influenced by genetic factors more than by the presence of the autoimmune disorder itself.},

abstract = {There are large differences between countries in the incidence of type 1 diabetes. Europe shows the greatest variation, with the highest incidence in the north-east and lowest in the south-west of the continent. Much of the variation can be explained by genetic differences, but there are notable exceptions and intriguing within-country variations which suggest environmental causes for the disease. One of the most interesting recent findings is a dramatic increase in diabetes (3.2% per year), predominantly in younger children. The incidence in Finland is now over five times greater than it was 50 years ago. Recently the rise has been most dramatic in countries undergoing substantial socio-economic change, such as those of Eastern Europe. The increase has been attributed to many causes, including diet, enterovirus infection, hygiene, and vitamin D. Epidemiology suggests new approaches for diabetes prevention on a population-wide scale which represents the background of most patients with diabetes.},

Our previous data suggested that dominant CTL-inducing and Th-inducing determinants might preferentially occur in proximal GAD65 sequences. Using a panel of 192 GAD65 peptides we discovered that four of the eight CTL-inducing peptides, including those most biologically relevant, were proximal to previously described I-Ag7-restricted determinants that characterize natural islet autoimmunity in NOD mice. The CTL determinants 546-554 and 88-98 were presented by GAD65-expressing cells and were displayed on pancreatic LNC, along with 268-278, following beta cell damage. p546-554-specific CTL were detectable in young naive mice and transferred significant islet inflammation into NOD.scid mice. These findings demonstrate that unique regions of GAD65 may be favored during antigen processing, such that diverse dominant epitopes are produced from overlapping sequences, which can engage distinct T cell subsets. Additionally, cross-presentation may enhance GAD65-specific CTL responses in T1D.},

abstract = {Islet transplantation is a promising treatment option for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D); however, the fate of the graft over time remains difficult to follow, due to the lack of available tools capable of monitoring graft rejection and inflammation prior to islet graft loss. Due to the challenges imposed by the location of the pancreas and the sparsely dispersed beta-cell population within the pancreas, currently, the clinical verification of beta-cell abnormalities can only be obtained indirectly via metabolic studies, which typically is not possible until after a significant deterioration in islet function has already occurred. The development of non-invasive imaging methods for the assessment of the pancreatic beta-cells, however, offers the potential for the early detection of beta-cell dysfunction prior to the clinical onset of T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Ideal islet imaging agents would have an acceptable residence time in the human body, be capable of providing high-resolution images with minimal uptake in surrounding tissues (e.g., the liver), would not be toxic to islets, and would not require pre-treatment of islets prior to transplantation. A variety of currently available imaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bioluminescence imaging (BLI), and nuclear imaging have been tested for the study of beta-cell diseases. In this article, we summarize the recent advances made in nuclear imaging techniques for non-invasive imaging of pancreatic beta-cells. The use of radioactive probes for islet imaging is also discussed.},

Many broad-based immunosuppressive and antigen-specific immunoregulatory therapies have been and are currently being evaluated for their utility in the prevention and treatment of T1D. Looking forward, this review discusses the potential therapeutic use of antigen-specific tolerance strategies, including tolerance induced by ``tolerogenic'' antigen-presenting cells pulsed with diabetogenic antigens and transfer of induced or expanded regulatory T cells, which have demonstrated efficacy in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Depending on the time of therapeutic intervention in the T1D disease process, antigen-specific immunoregulatory strategies may be employed as monotherapies, or in combination with short-term tolerance-promoting immunoregulatory drugs and/or drugs promoting differentiation of insulin-producing $\beta$ cells from endogenous progenitors.},

Exogenous IL-2 can augment Treg cell numbers in vivo and may have therapeutic value in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Complexes of IL-2 with different IL-2 antibodies can target delivery to cells expressing all three receptor chains (Treg cells and activated T effector cells) or to cells expressing just CD122 and CD132 (NK cells and memory phenotype CD8+ T cells).},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused mostly by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic $\beta$-cells, the precise mechanism of which remains unclear. Two major effector mechanisms have been proposed: direct cell-mediated and indirect cytokine-mediated cytotoxicity. Cytokine-mediated $\beta$-cell destruction is presumed mainly caused by NO production. To evaluate the role of iNOS expression in T1D, this study used a novel iNOS inhibitor ONO-1714. ONO-1714 significantly reduced cytokine-mediated cytotoxicity and NO production in both MIN6N9a cells and C57BL/6 islets in the presence of IL-1$\beta$, TNF-$\alpha$, and IFN-$\gamma$. To evaluate whether NO contributes to diabetes progression in vivo, ONO-1714 was administered to four different mouse models of autoimmune diabetes: multiple low-dose STZ (MLDS)-induced C57BL/6, CY-induced, adoptive transfer and spontaneous NOD diabetes. Exposure to STZ in vitro induced NO production in MIN6N9a cells and C57BL/6 islets, and in vivo injection of ONO-1714 to MLDS-treated mice significantly reduced hyperglycemia and interestingly, led to complete suppression of cellular infiltration of pancreatic islets. In contrast, when ONO-1714 was injected into spontaneous NOD mice and CY-induced and adoptive transfer models of NOD diabetes, overt diabetes could not be inhibited in these models. These findings suggest that NO-mediated cytotoxicity significantly contributes to MLDS-induced diabetes but not to NOD diabetes.},

There were no significant differences between the T cell responses of the three groups to tetanus toxoid. However, the responses to hsp60 of the type 1 diabetes group (median SI=5) were significantly greater (P{\&}lt;0.01) than those of the type 2 group (median SI=1.67) and of the blood donors (median SI=1.7). Epitope mapping revealed significant responses to at least seven different peptides, with prevalent responses to the p277 peptide previously mapped in NOD mice and to peptide p32. Thus, newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients, similar to prediabetic and newly diabetic NOD mice, show heightened autoimmunity to hsp60 and hsp60 peptides.},

We hypothesize that ``unusual'' structural interactions of specific trimolecular complexes (MHC class II, peptide, and T cell receptors) are fundamental to the escape from the thymus of autoreactive T cells able to cause type 1 diabetes.},

abstract = {Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus misleading, despite our best efforts to improve the design and analysis of studies. Mendelian randomization-the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during gamete formation and conception-provides one method for assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding that may distort interpretations of conventional observational studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are described. The limitations of the approach include confounding by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and canalization-the buffering of the effects of genetic variation during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates how investment in the human genome project may contribute to understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health of modifiable exposures.},

abstract = {The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse spontaneously develops autoimmune type I insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) with a similar immunopathological profile to the human disease. Development of the disease in both the NOD mouse and in humans is under polygenic control and influenced by many environmental factors. Diabetes results from a specific T cell-mediated destruction of pancreatic insulin-producing islet $\beta$ cells. Both CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as macrophages are required for the development of diabetes in NOD mice. An intriguing similarity between murine and human diabetes is a T cell proliferative unresponsiveness (anergy) that may be a susceptibility factor to disease onset. Defective communication between antigen-presenting cells (APC) and T cells, and/or an aberrant production or activity of inflammatory cytokines (e.g. chemokines) in the thymus and periphery (e.g. pancreas) may account for the unresponsiveness of regulatory T cells leading to a loss of immunological tolerance to $\beta$ cell autoantigens in NOD mice and in diabetic humans.},

abstract = {A new sort of CD4{\&}{\#}xa0;+{\&}{\#}xa0;T cells, so-called regulatory T cells (Tregs), has been described in 1996. Tregs are suggested to have an important function consisting in controlling autoimmune reactions. In humans, absence of Tregs induces the IPEX syndrome characterized by the presence of several autoimmune diseases. These cells depend on interleukin-2 (IL-2) for proliferating and controlling the T effector cells (Teff) reaction, but they do not have the capacity to produce IL-2. In type 1 diabetes (T1DM), a hypothesis is that a lack of IL-2 in pancreas could prevent Tregs action and lead to beta cells destruction. In NOD mice, low dose IL-2 treatment at the initial time of diabetes can rescue insulin secretion by restoring proteins expression that are necessary for Tregs regulatory function in the pancreas. Using low doses instead of high doses IL-2 prevents Teff activation which also depends on IL-2. These results led to conduct a dose-effect trial in human T1DM. This trial aimed at determining the therapeutic condition, which induces Tregs activation without major side effects, in a therapeutic perspective to recover insulin secretion at the apparition of diabetes.},

Diabetic nephropathy is a huge component of the potential cost of diabetes both to the individual and society. For this reason, JDRF and others have prioritized programs aimed to advance our understanding of diabetic nephropathy and translate findings to benefit patients with T1D. Although the current standard of care has reduced the incidence of diabetic nephropathy, a significant proportion of those with T1D are still at risk for declining renal function and progression to end-stage renal disease. Carefully directed research is needed to discover and translate novel targets and biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy to improve the prognosis and outlook for those with T1D and at risk for end-stage renal disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The natural killer (NK) cells at the site of placentation express killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) that can bind to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-C molecules on trophoblast cells. Both these gene systems are polymorphic and an association of particular maternal KIR/fetal HLA-C genotypes has been shown in pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia and recurrent miscarriage (RM) share the pathogenesis of defective placentation and therefore we have now genotyped couples with RM.

METHODS AND RESULTS:DNA was obtained from the male (n = 67) and female (n = 95) partners of couples with three or more spontaneous miscarriages and genotyped for HLA-C groups and 11 KIR genes using the PCR-sequence-specific primer method (SSP). The frequency of the HLA-C2 group was increased in both parents (reaching significance only in the male partners, P = 0.018) compared with a parous control population. The KIR gene frequencies of the male partners were similar to controls, but the women had a high frequency of KIR AA haplotypes that lack activating KIR. In particular, the activating KIR for HLA-C2 groups (KIR2DS1) was significantly lower in these women (P = 0.00035, odds ratio 2.63, confidence interval 1.54-4.49).

CONCLUSIONS:This is the first report to identify a genetic male factor that confers risk in RM. These findings support the idea that successful placentation depends on the correct balance of NK cell inhibition and activation in response to trophoblast.},

abstract = {Objective To assess parental decision making and experiences in an autologous umbilical cord blood infusion study in young children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods Surveys were completed with 22 parents of children with T1D who received infusion and 22 parents who declined infusion. Results Parents who stored umbilical cord blood were middle-aged, highly-educated, Caucasian, married, and privately insured. Parents of children who did not receive infusion declined because they did not want to deplete their cord blood supply. Parents of children who decided to have their children participate in the infusion study were similar on approaches to storing cord blood and attitudes about research as compared to parents who declined to have their children participate in the infusion. Parents of children who received infusion were positive about their experiences and held expectations that infusion would lead to a T1D cure. Conclusions The manner in which cord blood is stored needs to be considered so that participation in future studies does not risk depletion of the cord blood supply. In addition, it appears that the process of storing umbilical cord blood leads to restricted demographic characteristics of eligible participants, which may impact recruitment in clinical trials. These results are relevant to designing future cord blood studies in T1D and other non-malignant diseases.},

Although putative Treg cells, characterized as CD4+CD25+FOXP3+CD62L+ T cells, are increased in Tgfb1−/− mice, they may be inadequate to control activated T cells since the ratio of activated T cells:putative Treg cells is several-fold higher in Tgfb1−/− mice than in control mice. We further show that whereas Tgfb1−/− mice that express a chicken OVA-specific TCR transgene (DO11.10) have an increase in putative Treg cells, there are no detectable CD4+CD25+ T cells in the spleens of DO11.10 Rag1−/− mice suggesting that Treg-cell generation is self-antigen dependent regardless of whether they express Tgfb1. Finally, we demonstrate that Tgfb1−/− T cells remain responsive to the suppressive effect of TGF$\beta$1 in vitro. These data suggest that TGF$\beta$1 is required for the regulatory function of Treg cells to prevent activation of T cells and autoimmunity.},

To characterize insulin-specific T-cell reactivity we studied T-cell responses to 10 insulin peptides derived from bovine (BI) and human insulin (HI) in 42 children with recently diagnosed T1D, 47 children with multiple autoantibodies and 111 autoantibody-negative control children with risk-associated HLA alleles. Proliferation responses detected in antigen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not differ between the three groups when the comparison was performed without considering HLA genotypes. However, significant differences were observed, when children with the high-risk genotype HLA (DRB1*03)--DQA1*05--DQB1*02/DRB1*0401--DQA1*03--DQB1*0302 were analyzed separately. The responses to the peptides including amino acids A1--12 derived from B1 and H1 were significantly higher in children with T1D (P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.008, P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.004, for B1 and H1, respectively) and in children with diabetes-associated autoantibodies (P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.002 and P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.001, respectively) than in control children. Positive responses (stimulation indices SI{\&}{\#}xa0;≥{\&}{\#}xa0;3) were seen more frequently in T1D children than in controls (4/7 vs 2/19; P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.03 and 4/7 vs 1/19; P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.01 for B1 and H1, respectively).

abstract = {Bone loss, described in individual groups of patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1D), autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) or celiac disease (CD) is usually viewed as a complication of these diseases. There is increasing evidence that alterations in the immune system may directly affect bone mass. Clustering of autoimmune diseases in the same individual might predispose to higher risk of osteopenia due to imbalance in immune regulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate bone involvement in clusters of the most common autoimmune diseases (T1D, ATD and CD) in children. The study was performed at a tertiary care center for the care of pediatric diabetes. One-hundred-two patients with T1D alone or associated with ATD and/or CD were studied; 13 patients had cluster of three autoimmune diseases. Amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS) was measured by phalangeal quantitative ultrasound and expressed as standard deviation score (SDS). AD-SoS SDS {\&}lt; −2 was considered indicative of osteopenia. Osteopenia was equally distributed among children with T1D alone (8.1%), T1D associated with ATD (7.7%) or CD (10.3%), while it was 53.8% in patients presenting with three autoimmune diseases. Poor compliance to gluten-free diet increased osteopenia to 18.8% in patients with T1D and CD and 80% in patients with three autoimmune disorders. No difference among groups was found with regard to gluco-metabolic control, calcium metabolism, thyroid function. In conclusion bone impairment in multiple autoimmune diseases might be considered not only a complication due to endocrine or nutritional mechanisms, but also a consequence of an immunoregulatory imbalance. Alterations of homeostatic mechanisms might explain an imbalance of osteoclast activity leading to osteopenia.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) represents a serious health burden in the world, complicated by the fact that disease onset can be preceded by a long time period without evident clinical signs. It would be then of critical importance to detect the disease in its early stages. In this direction, we seek here to identify early preinflammatory markers for autoimmune diabetes, mining our previously reported transcriptome data relevant to distinct early sub-phenotypes in the NOD mouse, associated with early insulin autoantibodies (E-IAA). More specifically we focus on secreted or transmembrane protein transcripts, identifying in this category 71 differentially expressed transcripts which are regulated at the early preinflammatory stages of T1D in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN). Following the expression patterns of these 71 transcripts, correspondence analysis (a multivariate analysis method) reveals a clear-cut segregation of the individual samples according to the early subphenotype used. Thus the 71 transcripts coding for secreted proteins constitute a candidate-set of predictive biomarkers for the development of autoimmune damage of the $\beta$ cells of the pancreas. The majority of these genes have human orthologs and accordingly they represent potential candidate biomarkers for the human disease. In addition, for predictive purposes, the analysis reveals the possibility to reduce significantly the size of the candidate-set in practice, with various genes displaying identical expression profiles.},

abstract = {Antigen-specific therapies are possibly the safest approach to prevent type 1 diabetes (T1D). However their clinical translation has yielded poor results and greater efforts need to be put into the development of novel strategies to ameliorate their clinical outcome. OX40 is a costimulatory molecule expressed by T cells after antigen recognition and has been implicated in the control effector but also regulatory T cells (Tregs) function in vivo. The activity of OX40 signal on Tregs function has been controversial. In this context we investigated whether an anti-OX40 agonist antibody treatment can ameliorate antigen-specific immune intervention for the prevention of T1D. We show that treatment of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice with an OX40 agonistic antibody (OX86) reduced type 1 diabetes (T1D) incidence by inducing both CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs and CD4+Foxp3− T cells expressing the latency-associated peptide (LAP). These OX86-induced CD4+Foxp3−LAP+ T cells also demonstrated suppressive activity in vitro. A significant increase in protection was observed when OX86 was combined with insulin B9:23 (insB9:23) peptide immunizations. Synergy resulted from an expansion of IL-10-expressing insB9:23-reactive Tregs which augmented the proportion of CD4+ T cells with in vivo suppressive activity. Consequently, CD4+ T cells purified from OX86/insB9:23 combination treatment prevented T1D development when adoptively transferred into recipient mice. These findings suggest that the requirement for OX40 signaling by antigen-induced Tregs can be dominant over its well-documented need for effector memory cell function and may have potentially important implications for improving the clinical translation of antigen-specific prevention of T1D and possibly other autoimmune disorders.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest a beneficial role for blocking CD103 signaling in preventing islet allograft rejection and thus Type 1 diabetes (T1D) in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. However, antibody blockade approaches generally raise anti-microbial safety issues, necessitating additional studies to address the possible adverse effects of antibody therapy. Here we report that CD103 had no significant impact on the development of primary and memory CD8+ or CD4+ responses after acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. In addition, CD103 was found to be dispensable for T1D progression in a rapid, CD8-mediated virally-induced T1D model (the rat insulin promoter [RIP]--LCMV), suggesting that its previous efficacy in the NOD mouse model may not be related to its effect on the generation, memory conversion and/or effector function of CD8+ or CD4+ T cells. While the data does not preclude a role for CD103 in T1D in its entirety, the current study does provide much evidence to suggest that CD103 blockade may prove to be a safe intervention for autoimmunity and allo-transplantation. While in cases of rapid microbial (CD8)-driven T1D CD103 antibody blockade may not limit disease progression or severity, in mucosally-driven cases of T1D anti-CD103 antibody treatment may provide a new and safe therapeutic avenue.},

abstract = {Autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are present in humans before and after the onset of clinical insulin-dependent diabetes (IDD). The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, a model of human IDD, develops mononuclear cell infiltration of the pancreatic islets ('insulitis') associated particularly in females with T cell-mediated destruction of the islet $\beta$ cells. In NOD mice of both sexes we detected serum antibodies to GAD (GAD Ab) that precipitate mouse brain GAD enzymatic activity. Antibodies in NOD sera also precipitate a Mr 65,000 protein from Triton X-100 extracts of 35 S-methionine-labelled NOD islets, identical in size to that precipitated by a monoclonal antibody to GAD. GAD Ab were not detected in other mouse strains. There were significant differences in the frequency, level and age at initial detection of GAD Ab between females of the NOD/Lt and NOD/WEHI lines, previously shown to have a higher and lower incidence of diabetes, respectively. Comparing NOD/Lt (n=26) and NOD/WEHI (n=20) females, in which diabetes occurred in 38% and 20% by 150 days, the frequency of elevated GAD Ab was 50 vs. 80%, the mean maximum GAD Ab levels 21.1 vs. 30.6% and the mean age at which GAD Ab were first detected 94 vs. days. No significant differences in these parameters were observed between male mice of either line. There was a significant negative correlation between the level of GAD Ab and the degree of insulitis in female mice from both lines. GAD Ab were not a prerequisite for the development of diabetes. In 7 of 10 female mice the onset of diabetes was preceded by a decrease of GAD Ab levels into the normal range. These findings indicate that, while GAD is a target of autoimmunity in the NOD mouse, GAD Ab do not necessarily correlate with the development of diabetes. Indeed, the difference between the two NOD lines and the inverse relationship with insulitis suggests that a strong humoral response to GAD may be associated with a less destructive pathology, as proposed in humans 'at-risk' for IDD.},

abstract = {Prolactin (PRL) is well known for its stimulatory effects on various components of the immune response. Experimentally induced high levels of PRL have been shown to correlate with the worsening of several autoimmune diseases. In contrast, lowering PRL levels may protect from the autoimmune process. We investigated in both sexes of NOD mice a spontaneous model of autoimmune type 1 diabetes, the effects of two drugs, a dopaminergic agonist, bromocriptine (BRC, 10 mg/kg), which is assumed to inhibit PRL secretion, and a dopaminergic antagonist, metoclopramide (MCP, 5 mg/kg), which in contrast stimulates PRL secretion, on the incidence of diabetes, the severity of insulitis, and PRL and glucose levels. Chronic treatment of NOD mice with MCP slightly aggravated development of diabetes. The dopamine antagonist tended to accelerate the onset of diabetes in females and significantly increased the number of islets with peri-insulitis in both sexes. The weak deleterious effects exerted by MCP in NOD mice may be related to its stimulatory action on PRL release. Contrary to the expected results, the dopamine agonist BRC did not protect from autoimmune diabetes. In contrast, the drug appeared to accelerate diabetes onset in males and significantly increased the number of islets showing insulitis in both sexes. This study underlines the complexity of the action of BRC which in NOD mice only transiently inhibits the release of PRL. Moreover, the aggravating actions of BRC may be related to the marked hyperglycemic effect of the drug observed in male and female NOD mice.},

SummaryBackground Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequent microvascular complication of type I diabetes (T1D). Some well-controlled type I diabetics may develop DR, while other poorly-controlled diabetics do not develop DR. This might be explained by certain susceptibility genes or protective genes. The purpose of our study is to search for any association between the HLA class I and II markers and DR in the Algerian population. Patients and methods This study was carried out in 52 T1D subjects with and without DR compared to 140 healthy controls. HLA typing was performed using the ``microlymphocytotoxicity'' technique. Results The frequency of HLA-A29 and HLA-DR9 antigens is higher in T1D with DR compared to T1D without DR and to controls with frequencies of HLA-A29 (59.26% vs. 0%, OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;∞, pc{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;4.6{\&}{\#}xa0;×{\&}{\#}xa0;10−7), (59.26% vs. 5.66%, OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;24.24, pc{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;7.6{\&}{\#}xa0;×{\&}{\#}xa0;10--10) and HLA-DR9 (29.63% vs. 0%, OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;∞, pc{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;1.310−3), (29.63% vs. 4.29%, OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;9.40, pc{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;7.010−5) respectively. However, the frequency of HLA-B49 antigen is significantly lower in T1D with DR than in T1D without DR (3.7% vs. 28%, OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.10, pc{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;8.8{\&}{\#}xa0;×{\&}{\#}xa0;10−3) and compared to controls (3.7% vs. 22.64%, OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.13, pc{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.011). Conclusion HLA-A29 and HLA-DR9 antigens are probably markers of susceptibility for DR while HLA-B49 antigen is probably associated with a protective effect in the Algerian population.},

abstract = {While it is generally agreed that apoptosis of pancreatic $\beta$-cells is the most important and final step in the progression of type 1 diabetes without which clinical diabetes does not develop, it has not been elucidated which molecule(s) are the real culprit(s) in type 1 diabetes. Perforin, FasL, TNF$\alpha$, IL-1, IFN$\gamma$, and NO have been claimed as the effector molecules; however, they, as a single agent, might explain only part of $\beta$-cell death in type 1 diabetes. While FasL was initially considered as a strong candidate for the most important death effector, following experiments cast doubt on such a hypothesis. Combinations or synergism between IFN$\gamma$ and TNF$\alpha$ or IL-1$\beta$ are being revisited as the death effectors, and molecular mechanism explaining such a synergism was addressed in several recent papers. The role of NF-$\kappa$B for pancreatic $\beta$-cell death in type 1 diabetes is also controversial. While NF-$\kappa$B plays anti-apoptotic roles in most other death models, its role in type 1 diabetes might be different probably due to the involvement of multiple cytokines at different stages of the disease progression and the peculiarity of pancreatic $\beta$-cells. Recent papers also suggested a role for Ca2+ in cytokine-mediated pancreatic $\beta$-cell death. Such participation of Ca2+ in $\beta$-cell death appears to have a close relevance to the mitochondrial events or ER stress that constitutes an important part of cell death machinery recently identified.},

In this study, we generated congenic NOD.CD72b mice that carry C57BL/6 (B6) mouse-derived centromeric chromosome 4 interval (24--45{\&}{\#}xa0;cM) surrounding the CD72b locus. Unexpectedly, NOD.CD72b mice were not protected from diabetes, but rather exhibited accelerated development of both insulitis and diabetes. Our result defines novel locus or loci in the vicinity of CD72 gene that negatively control diabetes, indicating that NOD disease is under complex genetic controls of not only Idd genes but also disease-resistant genes.},

The CTSL2 gene encodes the cysteine protease cathepsin V involved in antigen presentation in human cortical thymic epithelial cells, and involvement of the protease in autoimmunity has been suggested. This study aimed to evaluate CTSL2 as a candidate gene for T1D, and test whether the gene predisposes more generally to autoimmune diseases. Four polymorphisms aiming at tagging the CTSL2 locus were genotyped in 421 T1D families, and subsequently in 861 rheumatoid arthritis patients, 530 juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients, and 559 controls of Norwegian origin. Additionally, DNA from 83 German myasthenia gravis (MG) patients and 244 controls were investigated. A polymorphism, rs16919034, situated downstream of CTSL2 was associated with T1D (60.8%T, p = 0.008; pc = 0.03). An association with early-onset MG (45% in cases vs 36.6% in controls; p = 0.03) was observed for another polymorphism (rs4361859) situated upstream of the gene, but within the same linkage disequilibrium block. No association was observed in rheumatoid arthritis or juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Our findings suggest that the CTSL2 gene is associated with T1D and with early-onset MG.},

Study design This was a cross-sectional analysis of data from a 6-center US study of diabetes in youth, including 3947 individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and 552 with type 2 diabetes (T2D), using hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels to assess glycemic control. Results HbA1c levels reflecting poor glycemic control (HbA1c ≥ 9.5%) were found in 17% of youth with T1D and in 27% of those with T2D. African-American, American Indian, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander youth with T1D were significantly more likely to have higher HbA1c levels compared with non-Hispanic white youth (with respective rates for poor glycemic control of 36%, 52%, 27%, and 26% vs 12%). Similarly poor control in these 4 racial/ethnic groups was found in youth with T2D. Longer duration of diabetes was significantly asso∗ciated with poorer glycemic control in youth with T1D and T2D. Conclusions The high percentage of US youth with HbA1c levels above the target value and with poor glycemic control indicates an urgent need for effective treatment strategies to improve metabolic status in youth with diabetes.},

abstract = {We underwent a project aimed to define the clinical and immunological characteristics of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in a Colombian population. This was a multicenter and cross-sectional study. Patients were systematically interviewed and their medical records reviewed, using a questionnaire that sought information about demographic, clinical and immunological characteristics. Glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GADA), tyrosine phosphatase antibodies (IA-2A) and insulin antibodies (IAA) were examined by radioimmunoassay. There were 107 patients with T1D. Male:female ratio was 1:1. Half of the patients developed diabetes ketoacidosis at onset. GADA, IA-2A, and IAA were detected in 45%, 40%, and 69% of the cases, respectively. GADA positive patients were older and had a less duration of disease than patients without these autoantibodies (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.01). Association between breast feeding with the presence of antibodies or clinical characteristics was not observed. The results highlight some differences of T1D expression according to geographic location and ethnicity. Differences in age at onset and clinical variables may point to an environmental factor or deficient access to health care system. Genetic studies underway will provide important information in this population. These results might help to define public health policies in our population to improve T1D diagnosis, patients' quality of life and their outcome.},

To identify and characterize genes involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, we initiated a repetitive backcross of diabetes-resistant C57L/J mice onto the NOD strain. This breeding scheme was based on the premise that selection for the trait of disease resistance among genetically mixed mice could be used to maintain transmission of nonpermissive alleles from the diabetes-resistant strain at critical diabetes susceptibility loci. Each of the three recombinant congenic mouse lines derived by this strategy retains a unique constellation of C57L/J-derived DNA segments. Consistent with the involvement of different genetic loci, the pancreatic histology of disease-resistant mice differs from that in NOD mice in a line-specific manner. Functional studies using these lines demonstrate that pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes is a multistep process which can be blocked at a minimum of three critical, genetically determined points.},

We have studied the clinical characteristics, anti-islet cell antibodies (Ab) and HLA class II genotypes in 72 non-DR3/non-DR4 Caucasian patients, mainly adults, presenting with clinically typical IDDM. The DRB1∗08-DQB1∗0402-DQA1∗0401 haplotype frequency was increased in the patients compared to 272 non-DR3/non-DR4 controls (OR = 5.9, Pc {\&}lt; 0.005). This association was even stronger in the Ab-positive patients (DRB1∗08: OR = 7.2, Pc {\&}lt; 0.005; DQB1∗0402: OR = 9.2, Pc {\&}lt; 0.005; DQA1∗0401: OR = 9, Pc {\&}lt; 0.02). In those subjects the DRB1∗15 allele was less frequent than in controls (OR = 0.1, Pc = 0.05). By contrast, IDDM patients with no Ab showed no particular association with HLA class II allele although they had clinical and metabolic characteristics similar to that of Ab-positive subjects. The genetic basis for IDDM predisposition in the Ab-positive subgroup remains elusive since the DRB1∗08-DQB1∗0402 haplotype encodes an Asp57-positive DQ$\beta$ chain. However, all DR8 patients had a non-Asp57 encoding DQB1 allele on the second haplotype. Thus, trans-complementation leading to peculiar predisposing DQ$\alpha$$\beta$ heterodimers may occur. Alternatively, a direct role of the DRB1∗08 allele cannot be excluded. These results show that autoimmune type 1 diabetes occurs in non-DR3/non-DR4 subjects, mainly adults. They further support that IDDM, when defined on a clinical basis, encompass different pathogenetic entities.},

abstract = {Summary Although it was originally synthesised to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis, glatiramer acetate (GA) is actually used in the treatment of this human disease. Serendipity thus was responsible for the discovery of the therapeutic properties of what has become one of the only two first-line therapies currently approved for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Despite being discovered over forty years ago, novel aspects of the mechanism of action of GA are still being uncovered today. Initially, the immunomodulatory effects of GA were believed to involve high-affinity binding of the polypeptide to MHC Class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that GA activated a specific population of GA-reactive T cells of a type-2 helper (Th2) phenotype, promoting an antiinflammatory environment and the preferential migration of GA-specific Th2 cells into the central nervous system, leading to decreased local inflammation through `bystander suppression'. More recently, it has been shown that GA-reactive Th2 cells will secrete neurotrophins, important factors for neuronal survival and for axonal protection, in the central nervous system. Moreover, perhaps by this mechanism, GA increases proliferation, differentiation and survival of oligodendrocyte precursor cells; potentially enhancing myelin repair processes in situ. In parallel to this work, light has been shed on immunomodulatory effects of GA on other immune cell types. These findings were stimulated by the observation that adoptive transfer of GA-specific T cells alone had a limited capacity to suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis compared to injection of GA itself, suggesting that other cell types such as monocytes also played a role. It has now been documented that GA treatment can also modulate antigen-presenting cells such as monocytes, dendritic cells, and also additional adaptive immune system cell types such as CD8+ T cells and Treg cells. In this respect, it is important to note that the interplay between such antigen-presenting cells and T cells is fundamental given the coordinated and bidirectional interactions between these two cell types in the immune network.},

Tregs are required for mediating normal immune responses against pathogens and then terminating such responses when no longer required. However, Tregs also provide important regulation of autoimmune responses, specifically in preventing autoimmunity. They are defined by expression of surface markers and production of specific cytokines that dictate their mode of action. In this review we discuss the recent advances in the understanding of the biology of Tregs, with a focus on their role(s) in human endocrine disease. In addition, recent discoveries of how hormones influence the development and function of Tregs are highlighted.},

The associated region encompasses a gene encoding a thymus-specific serine protease (PRSS16), presumably involved in positive selection of T cells or in T-cell regulation. Fourteen PRSS16 polymorphisms were genotyped in two steps using a total of six T1D family data sets, as well as case-control materials for both T1D and celiac disease (CD). An association with a 15 base-pair deletion in exon 12 of PRSS16 was found on the DRB1*03-DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 haplotype for both T1D and CD, but it could not explain the more pronounced disease associations observed at marker D6S2223. We compared the performance of the 14 tested PRSS16 polymorphisms, selected after our previous comprehensive screen, against HapMap selected tag SNPs. Use of a HapMap based SNP selection strategy would result in loss of a large proportion of the genetic variation in PRSS16. Our data suggest that it is unlikely that polymorphisms within the PRSS16 gene are involved in the predisposition to T1D. However, we cannot rule out that regulatory polymorphisms located some distance away from the gene may be involved.},

abstract = {Aims The impact of leptin deficiency and its replacement in T1D remain unclear in the context of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. The current study has investigated the physiologic role of leptin in lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis in T1D. Methods and results The present study has employed Ins2+/Akita:apoE−/− mouse model that spontaneously develops T1D, hypercholesterolemia, and atherosclerosis. At age 13 weeks, diabetic Ins2+/Akita:apoE−/− mice showed leptin deficiency by ∼92% compared with nondiabetic Ins2+/+:apoE−/− mice. From 13 weeks to 25 weeks of age, diabetic Ins2+/Akita:apoE−/− mice were treated with low-dose leptin (at 0.4 $\mu$g/g body weight daily). Leptin treatment diminished food intake by 22--27% in diabetic mice without affecting body weight and lean mass throughout the experiment. Importantly, leptin therapy substantially reduced plasma cholesterol concentrations by ∼41%, especially in LDL fractions, in diabetic Ins2+/Akita:apoE−/− mice. Moreover, leptin therapy decreased atherosclerotic lesion in diabetic mice by ∼62% comparable to that seen in nondiabetic mice. In addition, leptin restored repressed expression of hepatic sortilin-1, a receptor for LDL clearance, and reversed altered expression of several hepatic genes involved in lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis characteristic of diabetic mice. These findings were accompanied by normalization of reduced hepatic expression of Irs1 and Irs2 mRNA as well as their protein levels, and improved hepatic insulin-receptor signaling. Conclusions The present findings suggest that leptin administration may be useful to improve dyslipidemia and reduce atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular disease in human subjects with T1D.},

The [(NOD+BALB/c)→NOD] chimeras developed insulitis and diabetes, indicating that BALB/c bone marrow cells do not interfere with the development of the disease in NOD mice. Surprisingly, these mice have been reconstituted with only NOD hematolymphoid cells. When the pancreatic tissues from newborn NOD and BALB/c mice were grafted into [(NOD+BALB/c)→NOD] chimeras, the BALB/c pancreatic tissues were rejected, whereas the NOD graft showed insulitis. Furthermore, the spleen cells of the chimeras showed responsiveness to BALB/c spleen cells in mixed lymphocyte reaction and generated cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for the H-2d and third party targets. These findings indicate that the hematolymphoid cells (including hemopoietic stem cells) of NOD mice are more resilient than those of normal BALB/c mice, and that insulindependent diabetes mellitus will recur after bone marrow transplantation unless the hematolymphoid cells of NOD mice are completely destroyed by irradiation.},

Conversely, homeostatic proliferation can promote tumor immunity by allowing tumor-specific T cells to accumulate. In this review, we discuss how the outcome of homeostatic proliferation can function both in a deleterious manner in autoimmunity and a beneficial way in tumor immunity. We also discuss the roles of various cytokines and T regulatory cells that control homeostatic proliferation.},

To date numerous lines of evidence coming from both mouse models and patients with autoimmune diabetes underline the high complexity of the mechanisms underlying the disease, which is caused by a combination of genetic, environmental and dysregulatory mechanisms that might vary considerably from patient to patient. This review aims to provide some understanding of how T1D occurs and can be prevented in humans. Section Editor: Luciano Adorini -- BioXell, Milan, Italy Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic $\beta$ cells. Although a wealth of information is available, the etiology of type 1 diabetes is still incompletely understood and this is certainly an important factor explaining the lack of effective treatments. However, progress in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease continues, both in animal models and in humans. von Herrath and colleagues are recognized leaders in the field, and their review offers an interesting perspective of current research, designing plausible scenarios that help in conceptualizing the intricate complexity of pathogenetic mechanisms underlying type 1 diabetes.},

abstract = {Introduction The PTPN22 is a negative regulator of the T cell response. Its +1858C{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}gt;{\&}{\#}xa0;T (R620W) polymorphism has been shown to associate with a risk for multiple autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The minor (susceptibility) allele is absent in Asian populations, but a recent study suggested an independent involvement of another polymorphism located within the promoter −1123 nucleotides relative to the translational start site. Aims We aimed to analyse the association of three PTPN22 polymorphisms in two distinct Caucasian populations, the Czechs (with T1D and with JIA) and Azeri (with T1D). Methods The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at positions −1123 (rs2488457), +1858 (rs2476601, the R620W substitution), and +2740 (rs1217412) were genotyped using TaqMan assays in 372 subjects with childhood-onset T1D, 130 subjects with JIA, and 400 control subjects of Czech origin, and in 160 subjects with T1D and 271 healthy controls of Azeri origin. Results In the Czechs, all three SNPs were in a tight linkage disequlibrium, while in the Azeri, the linkage disequlibrium was limited to between the promoter and 3′-UTR polymorphism, D′(−1123, +2740){\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.99, r2{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.72. Haplotype reconstruction via the expectation--maximization algorithm showed in both populations that only the haplotype containing the minor (W) allele at codon 620 was associated with T1D (OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;2.26, 95% CI 1.68--3.02 in Czechs, OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;14.8, 95% CI 2.0--651 in Azeri) or JIA (OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;2.43, 95% CI 1.66--3.56 in Czechs). The haplotypes having the wild-type (R) allele at codon 620 and minor alleles at −1123{\&}{\#}xa0;and/or +2740 were neutral as to the risk of autoimmune conditions in both populations. Conclusions In two different Caucasian populations, the Czechs and the Azeri, no independent contribution can be detected either of the −1123 promoter SNP or the +2740 3′-UTR SNP, and only the minor allele at PTPN22 codon 620 contributes to the risk of autoimmunity.},

abstract = {Summary Type 1 diabetes is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease, characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the pancreatic islets. It is currently thought that islet antigen specificity is not a requirement for islet entry and that diabetogenic T cells can recruit a heterogeneous bystander T cell population. We tested this assumption directly by generating T cell receptor (TCR) retrogenic mice expressing two different T cell populations. By combining diabetogenic and nondiabetogenic or nonautoantigen-specific T cells, we demonstrate that bystander T cells cannot accumulate in the pancreatic islets. Autoantigen-specific T cells that accumulate in islets, but do not cause diabetes, were also unaffected by the presence of diabetogenic T cells. Additionally, 67% of TCRs cloned from nonobese diabetic (NOD) islet-infiltrating CD4+ T cells were able to mediate cell-autonomous islet infiltration and/or diabetes when expressed in retrogenic mice. Therefore, islet entry and accumulation appears to be a cell-autonomous and tightly regulated event and is governed by islet antigen specificity.},

abstract = {Analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mRNA/DNA and cross-species protein alignments. A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. BLAT is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based BLAT server for the human genome.},

DRB1-DQA1-DQB1 alleles were determined by polymerase chain reaction/sequence-specific primer genotyping. This study first revealed the great haplotype diversity of Brazilians (65 different haplotypes even with incomplete DRB1 subtyping), probably due to the admixture of Africans genes with European and Amerindian genes in this population. The results revealed increased frequencies of the DRB1∗03-DQA1∗0501-DQB1∗02 and DRB1∗0401-DQA1∗03-DQB1∗0302 haplotypes in the patient group The highest risk for type I diabetes was associated with the heterozygote DRB1∗03/∗04 genotype as largely reported, and DRB1∗03/X and DRB1∗04/Y genotypes conferred a significant, but much lower disease risk. Protection from type I diabetes revealed some peculiarities in Southeastern Brazilians: a lack of significant protecting effect of the DRB1∗1501-DQA1∗0102-DQB1∗0602 haplotype, and an apparent protection conferred by the DRB1∗13-DQB1∗0301, DRB1∗11-DQB1∗0301, and DRB1∗01-DQB1∗0501 two-locus haplotypes. The risk to type I diabetes in the highly diversified Southeastern Brazilians evidenced specific information to the prediction of the disease in this region of the country.},

The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. For example, the book presents - without having defined determinants - a clean proof that every linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space has an eigenvalue. The book starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basics, and dimension. Students are introduced to inner-product spaces in the first half of the book and shortly thereafter to the finite- dimensional spectral theorem. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. This second edition features new chapters on diagonal matrices, on linear functionals and adjoints, and on the spectral theorem; some sections, such as those on self-adjoint and normal operators, have been entirely rewritten; and hundreds of minor improvements have been made throughout the text.},

abstract = {Oral administration of porcine insulin has been shown to be effective in preventing the spontaneous occurrence of diabetes in the Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mouse model. In present study, we demonstrate that feeding 6-week-old female with 20 units of human insulin every 2-3 days for 30 days induces an active mechanism of suppression through the generation of regulatory T cells. Adult irradiated NOD males i.v. injected with 5 × 106T cells from the spleens of diabetic female donors and the same number of T cells from the spleens of insulin-fed animals had less successful diabetes transfer than controls (4/15 vs. 8/16, P{\&}lt;0.001). Protection from clinical diabetes was associated with a reduction in severe insulitis (16.4 $\pm$ 3.6% vs. 52.3 $\pm$ 12.8%, P=0.023). However, more than 85% of the islets were inflamed. Feeding animals for 15 days reduced the magnitude of this protection since the number of successful transfer after 1 month was comparable (12/17 vs. 14/17) despite a significant delay in diabetes onset (P{\&}lt;0.001). No difference in the contribution of T cell subsets was noted by cytofluorometry in the spleens of treated animals. When T cell subsets from insulin-fed animals were co-injected with diabetogenic T cells, only purified CD4+ T cells were able to transfer protection since only 3/12 mice became diabetic after 36 days in comparison to 3/6 in the group co-injected with CD4+ T cells from PBS-fed animals, or 5/6 in the group injected with CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, active protection against autoimmune diabetes occurs during oral administration of human insulin in the NOD mouse. Regulatory CD4+ T cells probably interact with diabetogenic T cells within the islets. These results may have important clinical implications in humans.},

abstract = {Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus (IDDM) caused by T cells which destroy the insulin-producing islet $\beta$-cells. Since cytokines are involved in this auto-immune $\beta$-cell damage, we used an ELISPOT assay to enumerate the islet-associated T cells that secreted interferon-gamma (IFN-$\gamma$), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) or interleukin-4 (IL-4). We used mitogenic anti-CD3 antibody to activate all the T cells capable of responding, irrespective of their antigen specificity. We found that NOD females, more susceptible than males to IDDM, accumulated islet IFN-$\gamma$ producers more rapidly with age than did the males. Acceleration of male IDDM by cyclophosphamide led to a marked increase in IFN-$\gamma$ secreting islet T cells. In contrast, a decrease in IFN-$\gamma$-producing islet T cells was associated with arrest of IDDM by administration of peptide p277 of the 60{\&}{\#}xa0;kDa heat-shock protein (hsp60) to 12-week-old female NOD mice. The p277-treated mice later manifested a greater number of islets and fewer leukocytes per islet than did the mice treated with a bacterial hsp60 peptide. Thus, the development of diabetes could be correlated with the accumulation in the islets of T cells producing IFN-$\gamma$, and destructive insulitis could be downregulated by the administration of a single peptide.},

However, the role of IL-12 in inducing immune tolerance that prevents insulitis and inhibits type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether intermittent administration of IL-12 could prevent the development of T1D in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. We examined whether IL-12 treatment prevented diabetes by injecting different doses of IL-12 into NOD mice and compared the incidence of diabetes and insulitis in NOD mice with the incidence in control mice. Furthermore, we investigated the potential mechanisms of IL-12-mediated prevention of diabetes and insulitis. The expression of pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines was measured before and following therapeutic administration of IL-12 in NOD mice. Our data demonstrated that both the absolute number and the function of DCs were impaired in NOD mice and that the levels of the Th17-associated pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1$\beta$, IL-6 and IL-23, were elevated in NOD mice compared with age-matched BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. However, treatment of NOD mice with IL-12 suppressed insulitis and increased the number of healthy islets, and the levels of IL-17, IL-1$\beta$, IL-6 and IL-23 were significantly decreased. Moreover, IL-12 treatment of NOD mice induced the secretion of IFN-$\gamma$, a potent inhibitor of Th17 cells. These data indicated that intermittent administration of IL-12 prevented diabetes by inducing IFN-$\gamma$, suppressing the pathogenic IL-17-producing cells and reducing the expression of Th17-associated pro-inflammatory cytokines.

abstract = {This protocol details the steps for data quality assessment and control that are typically carried out during case-control association studies. The steps described involve the identification and removal of DNA samples and markers that introduce bias. These critical steps are paramount to the success of a case-control study and are necessary before statistically testing for association. We describe how to use PLINK, a tool for handling SNP data, to perform assessments of failure rate per individual and per SNP and to assess the degree of relatedness between individuals. We also detail other quality-control procedures, including the use of SMARTPCA software for the identification of ancestral outliers. These platforms were selected because they are user-friendly, widely used and computationally efficient. Steps needed to detect and establish a disease association using case-control data are not discussed here. Issues concerning study design and marker selection in case-control studies have been discussed in our earlier protocols. This protocol, which is routinely used in our labs, should take approximately 8 h to complete.},

abstract = {Cellular autoimmunity is thought to be primarily responsible for the selective destruction of islet beta cells in Type I diabetes. Why the T lymphocyte reacts to self and recognizes the beta cell as foreign, as against the other endocrine islet cells, is unknown. One key issue is whether the beta cell itself is capable of presenting autoantigen(s) and thereby breaking T lymphocyte tolerance. In this paper we discuss current concepts of antigen presentation and relate these to recent findings from our laboratory, suggesting that the beta cell can be induced to display many of the phenotypic properties of classical antigen-presenting cells, including induction of MHC and ICAM-1 expression and production of IL-6. Finally, a model is presented which provides a new view of the initiation and perpetuation of autoimmune beta-cell destruction in Type I diabetes.},

abstract = {Genetic vaccines encoding pancreatic beta cell antigens can prevent autoimmune (type 1) diabetes when delivered into murine model systems, but there is a need to improve their efficacy. Here, we investigated the effects of intramuscular delivery of DNA coding for the pro-apoptotic protein BAX together with an intracellular or a secreted form of the beta cell antigen glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) on diabetes onset and immune responses in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. We hypothesized that induction of apoptosis in vaccine-containing cells could lead to GAD tolerance and disease suppression. Remarkably, monitoring of spontaneous diabetes onset indicated that only delivery of DNA coding for secreted GAD and BAX resulted in significant prevention of the disease. Using GFP as a model plasmid-encoded antigen revealed that co-delivery of BAX resulted in the recruitment of GFP-containing dendritic cells (DCs) in the draining lymph nodes and spleen of NOD mice. Furthermore, data indicated that subcellular localization of GAD had an effect on both the number and function of antigen presenting cells (APCs) recruited by BAX as well as on IFN-$\gamma$ secretion, and that diabetes suppression was unlikely to be caused by increased T helper 2 (Th2)-like activity. Our results indicate that, under certain conditions, co-delivery of DNA encoding BAX can improve the efficacy of genetic vaccination for prevention of pathogenic autoimmunity via a mechanism likely to involve modulation of antigen presenting cell function. In addition, our data also suggest that properties associated with subcellular localization of an antigen in apoptotic cells can have a significant effect on induced immune responses.},

abstract = {The appropriate regulation of intracellular calcium is a requirement for proper cell function and survival. This review focuses on the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on calcium regulation in the insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cell and how normal stimulus-secretion coupling, organelle function, and overall beta-cell viability are impacted. Proinflammatory cytokines are increasingly thought to contribute to beta-cell dysfunction not only in type 1 diabetes (T1D), but also in the progression of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Cytokine-induced disruptions in calcium handling result in reduced insulin release in response to glucose stimulation. Cytokines can alter intracellular calcium levels by depleting calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and by increasing calcium influx from the extracellular space. Depleting ER calcium leads to protein misfolding and activation of the ER stress response. Disrupting intracellular calcium may also affect organelles, including the mitochondria and the nucleus. As a chronic condition, cytokine-induced calcium disruptions may lead to beta-cell death in T1D and T2D, although possible protective effects are also discussed. Calcium is thus central to both normal and pathological cell processes. Because the tight regulation of intracellular calcium is crucial to homeostasis, measuring the dynamics of calcium may serve as a good indicator of overall beta-cell function.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by an autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet insulin-producing cells. Autoimmunity and shortage of insulin-producing cells are 2 key issues for the treatment of T1D. To cure T1D in a comprehensive manner, both issues need to be addressed simultaneously. Not only must the islet cells be replaced, the patient's immune system also must be dealt with. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and self-tolerance through their inhibitory impacts on autoreactive effector T cells. We identified a novel type of stem cells from human umbilical cord blood, designated cord blood stem cells (CB-SC), which may be able to address immune modulation of the autoimmune process and allow for $\beta$-cell replacement. We are the first group using CB-SC to correct functional defects of CD4+CD62L+ Tregs, leading to a reversal of overt diabetes in an autoimmune-caused diabetic NOD mouse model. Notably, treatment with CB-SC-modulated CD4+CD62L+ Tregs (mCD4CD62L Tregs) simultaneously can overcome the autoimmunity via systemic and local immune modulations and the shortage of insulin-producing cells via stimulating the $\beta$-cell regeneration. These new stem cells will offer a promising avenue for the development of powerful autologous therapeutic products for prevention and reversal of T1D.},

Study design Randomized, placebo-controlled 6-month 2-site trial of pioglitazone therapy in 35 adolescents with T1D, high insulin requirements ({\&}gt;0.9 U/kg/d), and suboptimal metabolic control (A1c 7.5%-11%), with the primary outcome of change in A1c. Secondary outcomes include change in insulin dose, body mass index (BMI), lipids, and waist and hip circumference. Results Metabolic control (A1c) was improved at 6 months in all subjects (P = .02). There was no significant difference between the pioglitazone and placebo treatment groups at 6 months in either change in A1c (−0.4% $\pm$ 0.9% and −0.5% $\pm$ 1.2%, respectively) or insulin dose. BMI SDS increased by 0.3 $\pm$ 0.3 (kg/m2) in the pioglitazone group and remained unchanged in the placebo group (P = .01). There was no significant difference in change in any lipid parameters between the pioglitazone and placebo groups at 6 months. Conclusions Adjunctive pioglitazone therapy was not effective in improving glycemic control in adolescents with T1D. Pioglitazone was associated with increased BMI.},

abstract = {Aim Although the incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been increasing, little is known of its quality of care. Thus, our survey was designed to retrospectively evaluate this issue in French patients. Methods Patients with T1D living in northeastern France were identified thanks to the healthcare system (CPAM) database, and the resulting list reviewed by local diabetes specialists. All of the listed patients and their primary physicians were asked to fill in a questionnaire including clinical data, laboratory results and follow-up habits. The `optimized results' included CPAM-based results plus any specialized care provided during hospitalizations in diabetes and non-diabetes units, according to questionnaire data. Results A total of 227 individuals, for whom CPAM data were available, were identified as having T1D. From these patients, 174 questionnaires were answered, and optimized results (having both CPAM data and a completely filled-in questionnaire) were available for 149 patients. Of the 169 patients who responded, 71.3% reported at least a yearly visit with a diabetologist. This number reached 77.9% when optimized results were considered. Patients who received specialized care were younger, underwent HbA1c tests more often and were more frequently on optimal treatment; however, there was no difference in HbA1c values or in the prevalence of complications. Eye examinations and kidney tests had been performed at least once over the 2-year period in more than 87% of the patients, whereas around 30%, 21% and 23% had an eye exam, creatinine test and urinary albumin excretion measurement, respectively, only once over the same time period. Conclusion This is the first large-scale study of the quality of care in patients with T1DM in France, and it could serve as a preliminary survey for a national study. Although the follow-up was better than previously reported, there is still considerable room for improvement.},

In addition to the latent allocations, data augmentation is based on a stochastic representation of the skew-normal distribution in terms of a random-effects model with truncated normal random effects. For finite mixtures of skew normals, this leads to a Gibbs sampling scheme that draws from standard densities only. This MCMC scheme is extended to mixtures of skew-t distributions based on representing the skew-t distribution as a scale mixture of skew normals.As an important application of our new method, we demonstrate how it provides a new computational framework for automated analysis of high-dimensional flow cytometric data. Using multivariate skew-normal and skew-t mixture models, we could model non-Gaussian cell populations rigorously and directly without transformation or projection to lower dimensions.},

Early insulin treatment has been used to prevent IDDM in the rodent models of IDDM, and a prevention trial is underway in humans. The metabolic effects of insulin may not be involved in this prevention since, in NOD mice, the use of metabolically inert human insulin B chain was effective. We wished to ascertain whether immunization of diabetes-prone BB/W rats with insulin B chain, A chain, or both could alter the incidence of diabetes. Immunizations began by 30 days of age and the rats were followed until 120 days of age. Only immunization with insulin B chain plus adjuvant was effective in reducing the rate of diabetes. All immunization frequencies were effective, but a significantly lower rate of diabetes was achieved with injections every week. All of the doses tested resulted in significantly lower rates of diabetes. These data confirm in the BB rat model that immunization with insulin B chain in the presence of adjuvant can reduce diabetes incidence. The absence of any metabolic effect of B chain and the requirement for adjuvant suggest that this effect is mediated via modulation of the autoimmune response.},

In autoimmune conditions, breakdown in the tolerization process results in activation of self-reactive T cells and an immune attack on host tissues. Our understanding of the immune cells and signaling pathways that contribute to this breakdown in T cell tolerization mechanisms is beginning to be deciphered. In particular, the elucidation of the mechanisms that contribute to the release of host antigen, the identification of the antigen-presenting cells that present the host peptides to self-reactive T cells and the role of members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor/ligand families that contribute to inappropriate activation of self-reactive T cells is advancing. The accumulating data from these studies will hopefully provide new ideas for combating autoimmunity.},

The novel coinhibitory receptor BTLA may have a regulatory role in maintaining peripheral tolerance, however, its role in autoimmune diabetes is unknown. To explore whether the generation of tolerance aiming at BTLA will help therapeutic intervention in T1D, the NOD mice were treated with genetically modified dendritic cells (DCs) expressing BTLA. The results demonstrated that transfer of modified DCs significantly induced CD8+ T cell tolerance and attenuated the severity of diabetes. The findings suggest that genetically modified DC therapies enhancing the BTLA negative cosignal may prove valuable in treating T1D and other autoimmune diseases.},

Given reports suggesting bone marrow derived stem cell plasticity, we sought to determine whether such cells could give rise to pancreatic islet cells in vivo. In the context of autoimmune diabetes, we transplanted unfractionated bone marrow from $\beta$-gal trangenic donor mice into NOD mice prior to, at, and two weeks beyond the onset of disease. Successful bone marrow engraftment before diabetes onset prevented disease in all mice and for 1 year after transplant. However, despite obtaining full hematopoietic engraftment in over 50 transplanted mice, only one mouse became insulin independent, and no $\beta$-Gal positive islets were detected in any of the mice. To test whether tolerance to islets was achieved, we injected islets obtained from the same allogeneic donor strain as the hematopoietic cells into 4 transplant recipients, and 2 had a reversion of their diabetes. Thus allogeneic bone marrow transplantation prevents autoimmune diabetes and tolerizes the recipient to donor islet grants, even in diabetic animals, yet the capacity of bone marrow derived cells to differentiate into functional islet cells, at least without additional manipulation, is limited in our model.},

We describe this property of correlated evolution by characterizing each protein by its phylogenetic profile, a string that encodes the presence or absence of a protein in every known genome.

T2D patients reported being markedly more restrained when eating than did the T1D patients (P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.002), and their restraint increased along with their BMI (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.001). Patients who overate or binged also reported greater general hunger (P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.02) and disinhibition (P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.003) than did the NORM patients. Conclusion AEB is present in French diabetic patients at levels that are probably higher than among the general population. These results highlight the need for: (1) greater awareness among diabetes clinicians of the problem; (2) regular screening of diabetic patients for AEB; and (3) adaptation of therapeutic and dietary recommendations for this patient subgroup.},

abstract = {As part of a biomarker discovery effort in peripheral blood, we acquired an immunological profile of cell-surface markers from healthy control and untreated subjects with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Fresh blood from each subject was screened ex vivo using a panel of 50 fluorescently labelled monoclonal antibodies distributed amongst 56 pools of four antibodies each. From these 56 pools, we derived an immunological profile consisting of 1018 'features' for each subject in our analysis using a systematic gating strategy. These profiles were interrogated in an analysis with a screening phase (23 patients) and an extension phase (15 patients) to identify cell populations in peripheral blood whose frequency is altered in untreated RRMS subjects. A population of CD8(low)CD4(-) cells was identified as being reduced in frequency in untreated RRMS subjects (P = 0.0002), and this observation was confirmed in an independent sample of subjects from the Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation of MS at the Brigham {\&} Women's Hospital (P = 0.002). This reduction in the frequency of CD8(low)CD4(-) cells is also observed in 38 untreated subjects with a clinically isolated demyelination syndrome (CIS) (P = 0.0006). We also show that these differences may be due to a reduction in the CD8(low)CD56(+)CD3(-)CD4(-) subset of CD8(low) cells, which have a natural killer cell profile. Similarities between untreated CIS and RRMS subjects extend to broader immunological profiles: consensus clustering of our data suggests that there are three distinct populations of untreated RRMS subjects and that these distinct phenotypic categories are already present in our sample of untreated CIS subjects. Thus, our large-scale immunophenotyping approach has yielded robust evidence for a reduction of CD8(low)CD4(-) cells in both CIS and RRMS in the absence of treatment as well as suggestive evidence for the existence of immunologically distinct subsets of subjects with a demyelinating disease.},

Animal(s) Pregnant non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice were compared with non-immunodeficient mice. Intervention(s) In vivo and in vitro CXCL12 induction. Main Outcome Measure(s) Flow cytometric analysis and Treg cell migratory assay. Result(s) A significantly high percentage of spontaneous embryo resorption was observed in both syngeneic and allogeneic pregnant NOD mice. The percentage of embryo loss in allogeneic pregnant NOD mice was significantly decreased by treatment with Treg cells and CXCL12 injection; however, no such effect was observed in syngeneic pregnant NOD mice. In addition, the migration of Treg cells induced by CXCL12 was confirmed by both in vitro and in vivo migratory assays. CXCR4, the specific receptor for CXCL12, was expressed more intensively on Treg cells than on non-Treg CD3+ T cells, whereas CXCL12 was dominantly expressed in cytokeratin 7+ trophoblast cells at an early stage of gestation, and its expression reduced gradually during pregnancy. Conclusion(s) The higher level of embryo loss in allogeneic pregnant NOD mice may be due to the lack of Treg cells. CXCL12 can cause CXCR4+ Treg cells to migrate into the pregnant uterus and establish a beneficial microenvironment for the fetus.},

abstract = {Recent advances in molecular sequencing technology have allowed researchers to answer major questions regarding the relationship between a vast genomic diversity---such as found in the intestinal microflora---and host physiology. Over the past few years, it has been established that, in obesity, type 1 diabetes and Crohn's disease---to cite but a few---the intestinal microflora play a pathophysiological role and can induce, transfer or prevent the outcome of such conditions. A few of the molecular vectors responsible for this regulatory role have been determined. Some are related to control of the immune, vascular, endocrine and nervous systems located in the intestines. However, more important is the fact that the intestinal microflora-to-host relationship is bidirectional, with evidence of an impact of the host genome on the intestinal microbiome. This means that the ecology shared by the host and gut microflora should now be considered a new player that can be manipulated, using pharmacological and nutritional approaches, to control physiological functions and pathological outcomes. What now remains is to demonstrate the molecular connection between the intestinal microflora and metabolic diseases. We propose here that the proinflammatory lipopolysaccharides play a causal role in the onset of metabolic disorders.},

Here, we evaluate the impact of two ACE-inhibitors therapy, zofenopril and enalapril in NOD mice. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) development was monitored weekly through glycosuria measurement. Zofenopril and enalapril were dosed at 0.5 mg/kg/die orally. Animals were sacrificed at different points and aortas used for western blotting or for tissue bath experiments. Bovine aortic endothelial cells in high glucose medium are treated with zofenoprilat or enalaprilat. Cells and supernatant were utilised for western blot analysis and for nitrite/nitrate determination, respectively. In ex-vivo experiments chronic administration of both drugs restored PE-induced contraction but not Isop-induced vasodilatation, however only zofenopril reduced caveolin-1 expression. In vitro, both drugs inhibited caveolin-1 expression and increased NOx production. However, zofenopril caused inhibition of both parameters at a concentration 200 fold lower than enalalpril. In vivo, zofenopril delays the onset of diabetic conditions of about 50%, and ameliorates polyuria. In conclusion our data suggest that ACE-inhibitor therapy may be useful in IDDM, in particular sulphydrylated inhibitor would display a better efficacy especially if administered early on the development of diabetes.},

But how the DR and DQ molecules contrive to effect collectively the same function of T1D predisposition remains unexplained. We advance the Co-operative Specificity Theory which attempts to project the relationship by which this occurs. The Co-operative Specificity Theory says that what is involved and being observed is a phenomenon of specific reciprocal recognition between corresponding DR- and DQ-molecules in a haplotype, resulting in a co-operation that realizes effects: this specificity varies in degrees. It is a situation of co-operative participation restricted to a specific DR- and its corresponding specific DQ-molecules that results in susceptibility. Thus susceptibility may not result when a corresponding specific DR or DQ allele is substituted by a non-specific allele in the haplotype. It thus ensues that phenotypic protection identifies the absence of this specific co-operation between the respective DR and DQ molecules giving rise to no predisposition.},

The TNF gene locus is located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region and its genetic polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with T1D. However, it is not clear whether these associations are primary or caused by their linkage disequilibrium with other predisposing genes within the MHC. We have tested 2 TNF-$\alpha$ single nucleotide polymorphisms at positions −308G/A and −238G/A in the 5′ untranslated region and a (GT)n microsatellite TNFa in the North Indian healthy population and T1D patients with known HLA-A--B--DR--DQ haplotypes. The allele frequencies of TNFa5, −308A, and −238G were determined to be significantly increased among patients compared with controls. Although the observed positive association of −238G was caused by its presence on all 3 DR3+ groups, namely, B8--DR3--DQ2, B50--DR3--DQ2, and B58--DR3--DQ2 haplotypes associated with T1D in this population, the increase of the −308A allele was caused by its association with the latter 2 haplotypes. On the other hand, TNF −308G occurred on B8--DR3 haplotypes along with −238G and TNFa5 alleles, particularly in T1D patients with late disease onset (at {\&}gt;20 years of age). These results indicate that TNF associations with T1D are caused by their linkage disequilibrium with specific HLA-DR3--DQ2 haplotypes in the Indian population. Because polymorphisms in the promoter region regulate TNF expression levels (e.g., −308A), they retain crucial immunological significance in the development of T1D and its management.},

abstract = {Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) results from chronic, T-cell dependent, autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing $\beta$-cells in the Langerhans' islets of the pancreas. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop IDDM that resembles human type I diabetes. The susceptibility to diabetes in the NOD strain is a complex polygenic trait that determines a phenotype of immune alterations. The unique MHC class II molecule expressed by NOD mice (I-Ag7) plays a major role in the development of disease. Recently, it has been reported that I-Ag7molecules generate a lower proportion of compact $\alpha$$\beta$heterodimers, compared to other haplotypes. However, it is not clear whether this reflects an intrinsic defect of this molecule to bind peptide stably or is the result of abnormal processing and/or peptide loading into the I-Ag7molecule. Our aim was to develop and characterize a suitable antigen-presenting cell (APC) that expressed I-Ag7in the context of a non-diabetes-prone antigen processing and presentation machinery. Here, we report the generation of a mouse DAP.3 fibroblast cell line (DAP.3Ag7) that constitutively expresses high levels of I-Ag7. Using DAP.3 cells transfected with I-Ag7or I-Ak, we show that the expression of compact dimers in the same cell type is proportionally less for I-Ag7molecules than for I-Akmolecules, implying an intrinsic defect of the I-Ag7molecule as the cause for the low generation of compact dimers. However, DAP.3Ag7cells are able to process and present antigen, as indicated by I-Ag7-dependent IL-2 production by a GAD67-specific NDO T-cell hybridoma after stimulation with GAD and live, but not fixed, DAP.3Ag7cells. The IL-2 response to GAD when presented by DAP.3Ag7was significantly higher than the response to GAD presented by NOD splenocytes. Based on these data, we conclude that the low generations of compact dimers is an intrinsic feature of I-Ag7molecules and not affected by other genes in the NOD background. The DAP.3Ag7cell line should be a valuable tool with which to dissect the role of the I-Ag7molecule in antigen presentation and T-cell activation in NOD mice, which clearly contributes to the development of IDDM.},

abstract = {Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse results from a T lymphocyte mediated destruction of the insulin-producing $\beta$ cells of the pancreas and serves as a model for human type I diabetes. The NOD mouse develops insulitis at 4 weeks of age and diabetes later in life. It has previously been shown that a T helper 1 (Th1) response to the islet antigen, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65, henceforth GAD) spontaneously develops in NOD mice concurrent with the onset of lymphocytic infiltration into the islets (insulitis). The proliferative T cell response in the spleen is initially confined to the carboxy-terminal region of GAD65 (peptides 509--528 and 524--543) followed by a progression to nearby determinants and a variety of upstream determinants. We have produced a set of overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the 509--543 region of GAD and surveyed the responses raised by immunization with peptide GAD(524--543), which is the more immunogenic of the two peptides. NOD mice immunized with GAD(524--543) demonstrate splenic proliferative responses to 524--538 and 527--541 but not to 521--535 or 530--543. Four T cell hybridomas were produced from spleen cells of GAD(524--543)-immunized NOD female mice. Each hybridoma displayed a unique cytokine profile when stimulated with peptides 524--538 and 527--541, assaying IL-2, IFN-$\gamma$, and IL-5 production by peptide-stimulated hybridomas. To identify MHC and TCR contact residues critical for the stimulation of the hybridomas, a truncated peptide (GAD 526--538) and a panel of analogue peptides were synthesized containing single-amino acid substitutions. Hybridoma 35.13.2 was non-responsive to the truncated peptide and all of its variants. However, the four residues 530 (A), 531 (P), 536 (R), and 537 (M) were found to be critical for the activation of the three remaining hybridomas, suggesting that these positions in the GAD-524--543 determinant were MHC binding residues or conserved TCR contact sites.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Recent advances in automation technologies have enabled the use of flow cytometry for high throughput screening, generating large complex data sets often in clinical trials or drug discovery settings. However, data management and data analysis methods have not advanced sufficiently far from the initial small-scale studies to support modeling in the presence of multiple covariates.

RESULTS:We developed a set of flexible open source computational tools in the R package flowCore to facilitate the analysis of these complex data. A key component of which is having suitable data structures that support the application of similar operations to a collection of samples or a clinical cohort. In addition, our software constitutes a shared and extensible research platform that enables collaboration between bioinformaticians, computer scientists, statisticians, biologists and clinicians. This platform will foster the development of novel analytic methods for flow cytometry.

CONCLUSION:The software has been applied in the analysis of various data sets and its data structures have proven to be highly efficient in capturing and organizing the analytic work flow. Finally, a number of additional Bioconductor packages successfully build on the infrastructure provided by flowCore, open new avenues for flow data analysis.},

abstract = {Abstracts It is widely believed that CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) are defective in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and other autoimmune diseases. However, this conclusion is based on the suboptimal in vitro suppression results from very small numbers of subjects. Furthermore, the cells responsible for the suboptimal suppression have not been defined. Therefore, we carried out extensive in vitro suppression assays using both autologous and heterologous donors of Tregs, effector T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APC) from both T1D patients and normal controls. Our in vitro suppression data indicated that a significantly higher proportion (40.0%) of T1D patients have ``very low suppression'' activity (defined as{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;25%) by autologous Treg compared to controls (6.3%) (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.002). Meta-analysis of the published results confirmed this observation with 45.7% low suppressors in T1D and 7.8% in controls (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.00002). Interestingly, suppression assays using heterologous Tregs, effector T cells and APC suggest that the source of APC is correlated with the suppression activity. The frequencies of CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25hi T cells were found to increase with age in normal controls but not in T1D patients, resulting in significantly higher frequencies of CD4+CD25+ (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.001) and CD4+CD25hi (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.009) T cells in young T1D subjects than age-matched controls but slightly lower CD4+CD25+ (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.003) and CD4+CD25hi (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.08) T cells in old T1D subjects than age-matched controls.},

RNA samples were prepared from the islets and spleens of NOD mice at different time points at prediabetic stages during the natural disease process. Cytofluorometric analyses showed that the majority of lymphocyte infiltrates in the islets at 14 weeks of age consisted of T cells (68%). Of these, 80% of Thy1.2+ cells were CD4+ T cells. Less than 1% of in situ islet immune cells expressed a cell surface marker specific for the macrophage (Mac-1). Results of polymerase chain reaction using RNA (RT-PCR) prepared from spleens, and isolated and purified islets demonstrated that IFN-$\gamma$ message was detectable in the islets at 7 weeks of age (an early stage of insulitis). No message for this gene was detected in the spleen at any stage studied (7, 14 and 16 weeks of age). In contrast, TNF-$\alpha$ message was detected in both spleen and the islets at all stages, although the level of expression of TNF-$\alpha$ in the islets was much higher than that in the spleen. These results suggest that both cytokines are produced by in situ islet T cells, possibly activated T cells, which may be responsible for initiating or perpetuating autoimmune reactions in the islets.},

Here, we observed that apoptotic cells undergoing secondary necrosis but not intact apoptotic cells provoked substantial immune responses, which were mediated through the toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) pathway. The development of autoimmune diabetes was markedly inhibited in Tlr2−/− mice but not in Tlr4−/− mice, showing that TLR2 plays an important role in the initiation of the disease. Apoptotic $\beta$-cell injury could stimulate the priming of diabetogenic T cells through a TLR2-dependent, but TLR4-independent, activation of antigen-presenting cells. These findings suggest that $\beta$-cell death and its sensing via TLR2 may be an initial event for the stimulation of antigen-presenting cells and development of autoimmune diabetes.},

Here, we generated and analyzed GRAIL-deficient mice and found they were resistant to immune tolerance induction and exhibited greater susceptibility to autoimmune diseases than wild-type mice. GRAIL-deficient naive T cells, after activation, exhibited increased proliferation and cytokine expression than controls and did not depend on costimulation for effector generation. Moreover, GRAIL-deficient regulatory T (Treg) cells displayed reduced suppressive function, associated with increased Th17 cell-related gene expression. GRAIL-deficient naive and Treg cells were less efficient in downregulating T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 expression after activation and exhibited increased NFATc1 transcription factor expression; GRAIL expression promoted CD3 ubiquitinylation. Our results indicate that GRAIL, by mediating TCR-CD3 degradation, regulates naive T cell tolerance induction and Treg cell function.},

It is unclear whether CTL function is driven by signals received in the lymph node or also in the inflamed tissue. We studied whether the development of cytotoxicity requires further activation in islets. Autoreactive CTLs found in the islets of diabetes-prone NOD mice had acquired much higher expression of the cytotoxic effector markers granzyme B, interferon $\gamma$, and CD107a than had those in the pancreatic lymph node (PLN). Increased expression seemed to result from stimulation in the islet itself. T cells held up from migrating from the PLN by administration of the sphingosine-1-phosphate agonist FTY720 did not increase expression of cytotoxic molecules in the PLN. Stimulation did not require antigen presentation or cytokine secretion by the target $\beta$ cells because it was not affected by the absence of class I major histocompatibility complex expression or by the overexpression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1. Activation of CD40-expressing cells stimulated increased CTL function and $\beta$-cell destruction, suggesting that signals derived from CD40-expressing cells promote the acquisition of cytotoxicity in the islet environment. These data provide in vivo evidence that stimulation of cytotoxic effector molecule expression occurs in inflamed islets and is independent of $\beta$ cells.},

Treatment with anti-$\alpha$4-integrin monoclonal antibody (mAb) delayed the onset of insulitis and significantly delayed hyperglycemia to 66{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;5.8 days. Combination treatment with anti-$\alpha$4-integrin and anti-LFA-1 mAbs delayed the onset of diabetes to {\&}gt;100 days (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.0001). Combination-treated mice were subjected to a second challenge with diabetogenic splenocytes after 85 days of normoglycemia. Without additional mAb treatment they developed hyperglycemia after significant delay (72{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;8.1 days post-reinoculation). Splenocytes from combination-treated mice transferred protection from diabetes to na{\"\i}ve NOD-scid mice when co-transferred with diabetogenic splenocytes. The long-surviving mice showed periislet infiltration with CD62L+ cells, which were not seen in the insulitis developing in control animals. These findings suggest that adhesion molecule blockade does not prevent homing and may affect effector cell action through activation of immunoregulatory suppressor cells, leading to protection against development of diabetes.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a genetically complex disorder of glucose homeostasis that results from the autoimmune destruction of the insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas. Two previous whole-genome scans for linkage to T1D in 187 and 356 families containing affected sib pairs (ASPs) yielded apparently conflicting results, despite partial overlap in the families analyzed. However, each of these studies individually lacked power to detect loci with locus-specific disease prevalence/sib-risk ratios ($\lambda$s) {\&}lt;1.4. In the present study, a third genome scan was performed using a new collection of 225 multiplex families with T1D, and the data from all three of these genome scans were merged and analyzed jointly. The combined sample of 831 ASPs, all with both parents genotyped, provided 90% power to detect linkage for loci with $\lambda$s = 1.3 at P=7.4×10−4. Three chromosome regions were identified that showed significant evidence of linkage (P{\&}lt;2.2×10−5; LOD scores {\&}gt;4), 6p21 (IDDM1), 11p15 (IDDM2), 16q22-q24, and four more that showed suggestive evidence (P{\&}lt;7.4×10−4, LOD scores ⩾2.2), 10p11 (IDDM10), 2q31 (IDDM7, IDDM12, and IDDM13), 6q21 (IDDM15), and 1q42. Exploratory analyses, taking into account the presence of specific high-risk HLA genotypes or affected sibs' ages at disease onset, provided evidence of linkage at several additional sites, including the putative IDDM8 locus on chromosome 6q27. Our results indicate that much of the difficulty in mapping T1D susceptibility genes results from inadequate sample sizes, and the results point to the value of future international collaborations to assemble and analyze much larger data sets for linkage in complex diseases.},

Insulitis without overt disease occurs in the BDC2.5 TCR-transgenic NOD mice that express the rearranged TCR $\alpha$- and $\beta$-chain genes of a diabetogenic T cell clone reactive to an unknown $\beta$ cell autoantigen. A previous study identified an extensive panel of peptides that are highly active in stimulating T cells from transgenic BDC2.5 mice in culture. However, none of these peptides cause active disease in NOD and BDC2.5 animals or in NOD recipients of adoptively transferred BDC2.5 T cells following direct immunization in vivo. We show that direct immunization of transgenic BDC2.5 mice causes many BDC2.5 T cells to become activated and apoptotic. Strikingly, soluble peptides administered to recipients of activated, highly pathogenic BDC2.5 T cells results in protection from disease. These results suggest that high affinity peptide analogues of autoimmune epitopes might be useful as therapeutic modulators in active autoimmune disease.},

However, the immunologic mechanism leading to this beneficial effect in clinical transplantation is still not clear. The observation that blood transfusions sharing an HLA-DR antigen with the recipient are more effective than HLA mismatched transfusions has led to the hypothesis that CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells that recognize a foreign peptide in the context of the shared HLA-DR molecule play an important role in down-regulation of the immune response toward the graft. Available experimental evidence supports this hypothesis. Furthermore, these CD4+ Treg cells are able to modulate antigen-presenting cells, which in their turn will induce Treg cells. As long as clinical transplantation tolerance by blood transfusions is not a reality, further studies on the mechanisms of the beneficial effect of pretransplant allogeneic blood transfusions are needed to obtain an effective protocol for the induction of clinically relevant Treg cells.},

abstract = {In type 1 diabetes (T1D), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proinflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages and other innate immune cells destroy pancreatic $\beta$ cells while promoting autoreactive T cell maturation. Superoxide-deficient nonobese diabetic mice (NOD.Ncf1m1J) are resistant to spontaneous diabetes, revealing the integral role of ROS signaling in T1D. Here, we evaluate the innate immune activation state of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BM-M$\phi$) from NOD and NOD.Ncf1m1J mice after poly(I:C)-induced Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling. We show that ROS synthesis is required for efficient activation of the NF-$\kappa$B signaling pathway and concomitant expression of TLR3 and the cognate adaptor molecule, TRIF. Poly(I:C)-stimulated NOD.Ncf1m1J BM-M$\phi$ exhibited a 2- and 10-fold decrease in TNF-$\alpha$ and IFN-$\beta$ proinflammatory cytokine synthesis, respectively, in contrast to NOD BM-M$\phi$. Optimal expression of IFN-$\alpha$/$\beta$ is not solely dependent on superoxide synthesis, but requires p47phox to function in a NOX-independent manner to mediate type I interferon synthesis. Interestingly, MHC-II I-Ag7 expression necessary for CD4 T cell activation is increased 2-fold relative to NOD, implicating a role for superoxide in I-Ag7 downregulation. These findings suggest that defective innate immune-pattern-recognition receptor activation and subsequent decrease in TNF-$\alpha$ and IFN-$\beta$ proinflammatory cytokine synthesis necessary for autoreactive T cell maturation may contribute to the T1D protection observed in NOD.Ncf1m1J mice.},

abstract = {The interaction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and very late antigen-4 ($\alpha$4$\beta$1-integrin) has been recently known to be profoundly involved in the trafficking of lymphocytes from the circulation into the inflammatory tissues. To elucidate the role of these molecules in the development of autoimmune diabetes, the expression of these adhesion molecules on inflamed islets and the effects of administration of monoclonal antibodies to these molecules on insulitis and overt diabetes were evaluated in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, Immunohistochemical study revealed the overexpression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 on vascular endothelium near or within inflamed islets and $\alpha$4-integrin on islet-infiltrating mononuclear cells. Either anti-vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 or anti-$\alpha$4-integrin monoclonal antibody prevented the transfer of diabetes in irradiated NOD mice which received spleen cells from acutely diabetic NOD mice. When both monoclonal antibodies were administrated to NOD mice during 2-30 weeks of age, neither lymphocytic infiltration to islets nor overt diabetes was observed. Furthermore, administration of these antibodies even from 10 weeks of age could inhibit the development of insulitis and diabetes, whereas administration during 2-5 weeks of age could not. Splenocytes obtained from these treated mice showed no significant change of cytokine production and preserved the ability to transfer diabetes into NOD scid/scid mice. This suggests that treatment with antibodies against these adhesion molecules can inhibit insulitis and diabetes without affecting the Th1/Th2 balance or effector T cells. The blockade of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1/very late antigen-4 interaction would be suitable for therapeutical treatment of the predisposing and latent type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects.},

abstract = {At the time of this writing, a major void exists; the lack of a method to prevent and/or reverse type 1 diabetes in humans. We believe this void to a large extent is the result of our lack in understanding the mechanisms of autoimmunity that underlie beta cell destruction, a failure to understand the immunologic factors that contribute to type 1 diabetes, and the absence of immunologic tools which would allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease development and monitoring of therapeutic interventions. Due to this, an intense degree of research interest has recently been generated to understand the mechanisms that regulate the immune response and form a state of immunological tolerance. While some progress has been made towards these goals, additional investigations are needed to address the aforementioned knowledge voids including the role for regulatory T cells (Treg), defined by their co-expression of CD4 and CD25 as well as the transcription factor FOXP3, in the pathogenesis and natural history of type 1 diabetes. We and others have recently reported findings related to the frequency and function of Treg cells in type 1 diabetes, yet the resulting literature represents a somewhat conflicting body of findings. Our studies did not support the notion that altered Treg frequencies are associated with type 1 diabetes, but rather did identify alterations in the functional (i.e., suppressive) activities of these cells in subjects with the disease. The need to bring resolution to the aforementioned published discrepancies in frequency and function of Treg in type 1 diabetes represents the impetus for this critical review. In addition, we hope to highlight the need for expanded studies that address specific knowledge gaps regarding the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) related to the frequency and function of Treg.},

We have recently reported that infection of 2-month-old NOD mice withMycobacterium aviumprevents IDDM expression in these mice. We have searched here for changes in splenic lymphocytes that are associated with the effect ofM. aviumvaccination. Three experimental groups of female NOD mice were studied: (i) animals infected with 108viableM. aviumbacteria (mice that become protected from IDDM); (ii) mice inoculated with 108heat-killed (HK)M. aviumbacilli, and (iii) untreated age-matched NOD mice. Similar treatments were given to mice of the NON strain which are related to NOD mice but do not develop IDDM. Flow cytometry was used to compareM. avium-infected, HKM. aviuminoculated and untreated NOD and NON mice with regard to subpopulations of splenic lymphocytes bearing the surface antigens CD3, CD4, CD8, IgM and B220. We found thatM. aviuminfection of NOD mice caused a sustained enhancement in T cells that was due to an early and transient increase in CD8+T cells (detected at day 7 of infection). This was followed by marked augmentation in the number of CD4+T cells at days 14 and 30. There was also elevation in B220+B cells at days 14 and 30, and of IgM+B cells at day 30 of infection. Inoculation of NOD mice with HK mycobacteria, which did not prevent IDDM, failed to produce significant changes in the number of T and B cells. No significant enhancement in T and B cells was observed in NON mice that were injected with either viable or HKM. aviumbacilli. In NOD mice that reached 16 months of age because of being protected from IDDM (due to theM. aviuminfection) there was an increase in B220+B cells. We conclude that: (i)M. avium-induced protection of NOD mice from diabetes depends on the viability of the bacteria; (ii) the protective effect of the infection is associated with an early and marked increase in helper T cells and with a smaller elevation in B cells; (iii) elevation in B cells, but not in T cells, is associated with long term mycobacteria-induced protection of NOD mice from IDDM.},

An additional comparison was made between subgroups of patients with rapidly and slowly progressive adult-onset T1D (LADA). A DNA-based low-resolution analysis was performed for DRB1* and DQB1* alleles and a high-resolution analysis for DRB1*04 and DQB1*1 alleles. In all, 87% of the study group was positive for DRB1*03 or DRB1*04 compared with 36% of the healthy controls. The main alleles accounting for susceptibility to T1D were DRB1*0402, found in 77.9% of carriers of DRB1*04 and DQB1*0302, found in 74.6% of carriers of DQB1*03. The DQB1*0602 was not detected in any patient. The distribution was similar to that reported in Israeli children with T1D and significantly different from healthy Israelis. There was no significant difference in the distribution of HLA class II alleles between patients with rapidly progressive T1D or LADA. It may be concluded that the different ages of onset of T1D and its different forms of development in Israeli patients are apparently not caused by a different prevalence of HLA class II alleles.},

Studies on the protective effects of pathogens as diverse as parasitic helminths and intracellular bacteria suggest the possibility that different classes of infectious organism mediate different protective mechanisms. Parasites and the mammalian immune system have evolved together to limit damage to host tissue, which is important to the host for self-maintenance and to the parasite, in some cases, to maintain its habitat and complete its life cycle. By understanding the mechanisms by which different classes of parasites modulate the host immune response, we might be able to devise therapeutic strategies for the treatment of autoreactive responses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:CD25, a component of the IL-2 receptor, is important in T cell proliferation, activation induced cell death, as well as the actions of both regulatory (Treg) and effector (Teff) T cells. Recent genome wide association studies have implicated the CD25 locus as an important region for genetic susceptibility to a number of autoimmune disorders, with serum levels of soluble CD25 receptor (sCD25) serving as a potential phenotypic marker for this association. However, the functional impact of CD25 cleavage, as well as the influence of sCD25 on immunoregulatory activities, remain largely unknown and form the basis of this effort.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:The generation of sCD25 by Treg (CD4(+)CD25(+)) and Teff (CD4(+)CD25(-)) cells was examined during in vitro suppression assays, efforts that demonstrated constitutive and stable surface CD25 expression on Treg throughout the period of in vitro assessment. In contrast, Teff cells increased CD25 expression during the process of in vitro suppression, with supernatant sCD25 levels correlating to the amount of cellular proliferation. Interestingly, under serum-free conditions, Tregs partially lost their characteristic anergic and suppressive properties. sCD25 supplementation at physiological concentrations to serum free in vitro suppression assays reduced Teff proliferation without specifically influencing suppression. Indeed, sCD25 production within these cultures correlated with cell death.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:These results support the notion that sCD25 functions as both a surrogate marker of T cell activation as well as an indicator of subsequent cellular death. In addition, the role of CD25 in immunomodulation is likely dependent on the local inflammatory milieu, with molecules capable of modulating surface CD25 expression playing a key role in defining immune responsiveness.},

In an attempt to protect nonobese diabetic mice (NOD) from autoimmune diabetes, we made FasL transgenic NOD mice using the $\beta$ cell-specific rat insulin-1 promoter. Surprisingly, these transgenic mice showed heightened sensitivity to diabetogenic T cells, which was due to self-destruction of $\beta$ cells upon T cell-mediated induction of Fas. Fas-negative NODlpr/lpr animals were resistant to diabetogenic T cells and to spontaneous diabetes. Thus, induction of Fas expression on $\beta$ cells and their subsequent destruction constitutes the main pathogenic mechanism in autoimmune diabetes.},

abstract = {Regulatory T cells (Tregs) constitute an attractive therapeutic target given their essential role in controlling autoimmunity. However, recent animal studies provide evidence for functional heterogeneity and lineage plasticity within the Treg compartment. To understand better the plasticity of human Tregs in the context of type 1 diabetes, we characterized an IFN-$\gamma$-competent subset of human CD4(+)CD127(lo/-)CD25(+) Tregs. We measured the frequency of Tregs in the peripheral blood of patients with type 1 diabetes by epigenetic analysis of the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) and the frequency of the IFN-$\gamma$(+) subset by flow cytometry. Purified IFN-$\gamma$(+) Tregs were assessed for suppressive function, degree of TSDR demethylation, and expression of Treg lineage markers FOXP3 and Helios. The frequency of Tregs in peripheral blood was comparable but the FOXP3(+)IFN-$\gamma$(+) fraction was significantly increased in patients with type 1 diabetes compared to healthy controls. Purified IFN-$\gamma$(+) Tregs expressed FOXP3 and possessed suppressive activity but lacked Helios expression and were predominately methylated at the TSDR, characteristics of an adaptive Treg. Naive Tregs were capable of upregulating expression of Th1-associated T-bet, CXCR3, and IFN-$\gamma$ in response to IL-12. Notably, naive, thymic-derived natural Tregs also demonstrated the capacity for Th1 differentiation without concomitant loss of Helios expression or TSDR demethylation.},

abstract = {The clonal selection theory of immune reactivity is based on a metaphor of self/not-self discrimination and considers self-tolerance to result from clonal deletion. There is evidence that a deletional mechanism is responsible for negative selection of self MHC-reactive T-cells in the thymus. Bretscher/Cohn theory builds on this concept and provides a model which allows self/not-self discrimination to occur at any time throughout the life of the individual. However, modern concepts of antigen presentation in which MHC-peptide co-presentation is the unit recognised by the T-cell receptor have abandoned the Bretscher/Cohn requirement for associative recognition of antigen. For this reason, such models of APC function cannot use Bretscher/Cohn theory to explain self/not-self discrimination. Matzinger's `danger' metaphor for the immune system provides a theoretical way forward by moving the emphasis away from an immune system based on self/not-self discrimination. These theoretical developments lead to a novel approach to the control of autoimmunity that is based on the strengthening of immune regulation by the use of adjuvant therapy.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes presents clinically with overt hyperglycemia resulting from progressive immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic $\beta$-cells and associated metabolic dysfunction. Combined genetic and immunological studies now highlight deficiencies in both the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor and its downstream signaling pathway as a central defect in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Prior intervention studies in animal models indicate that augmenting IL-2 signaling can prevent and reverse disease, with protection conferred primarily by restoration of regulatory T-cell (Treg) function. In this article, we will focus on studies of type 1 diabetes noting deficient IL-2 signaling and build what we believe forms the molecular framework for their contribution to the disease. This activity results in the identification of a series of potentially novel therapeutic targets that could restore proper immune regulation in type 1 diabetes by augmenting the IL-2 pathway.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The recent development of semiautomated techniques for staining and analyzing flow cytometry samples has presented new challenges. Quality control and quality assessment are critical when developing new high throughput technologies and their associated information services. Our experience suggests that significant bottlenecks remain in the development of high throughput flow cytometry methods for data analysis and display. Especially, data quality control and quality assessment are crucial steps in processing and analyzing high throughput flow cytometry data.

METHODS:We propose a variety of graphical exploratory data analytic tools for exploring ungated flow cytometry data. We have implemented a number of specialized functions and methods in the Bioconductor package rflowcyt. We demonstrate the use of these approaches by investigating two independent sets of high throughput flow cytometry data.

RESULTS:We found that graphical representations can reveal substantial nonbiological differences in samples. Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function and summary scatterplots were especially useful in the rapid identification of problems not identified by manual review.

CONCLUSIONS:Graphical exploratory data analytic tools are quick and useful means of assessing data quality. We propose that the described visualizations should be used as quality assessment tools and where possible, be used for quality control.},

Different strategies are followed to restore physiologic production of insulin in diabetic patients. Restoration of self-tolerance remains the milestone that must be reached in order to move a step further and recover a cell source capable of independent and functional insulin production. Multiple strategies aimed at modulation of both central and peripheral immunity must be considered. Promising results now show that the immune system can be modulated in a way that acquisition of a ``diabetes-suppressive'' phenotype is possible. Once self-tolerance is achieved, reversal of the disease may be obtained by simply allowing physiologic rescue and/or regeneration of the $\beta$ cells to take place. Given that these outcomes have already been confirmed in humans, refinement of existing protocols along with novel methods adapted to T1DM reversal will allow translation into clinical trials.},

However, translating Treg-based therapies from animal models of autoimmunity to human clinical trials requires robust methods for the isolation and expansion of these cells-a need forming the basis for these studies.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:Tregs from recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients and healthy control subjects were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and compared for their capacity to expand in vitro in response to anti-CD3-anti-CD28-coated microbeads and IL-2. Expanded cells were examined for suppressive function, lineage markers and FOXP3, and cytokine production.

RESULTS:Both CD4+CD127(lo/-) and CD4+CD127(lo/-)CD25+ T-cells could be expanded and used as Tregs. However, expansion of CD4+CD127(lo/-) cells required the addition of rapamycin to maintain lineage purity. In contrast, expansion of CD4+CD127(lo/-)CD25+ T-cells, especially the CD45RA+ subset, resulted in high yield, functional Tregs that maintained higher FOXP3 expression in the absence of rapamycin. Tregs from type 1 diabetic patients and control subjects expanded similarly and were equally capable of suppressing T-cell proliferation. Regulatory cytokines were produced by Tregs after culture; however, a portion of FOXP3+ cells were capable of producing interferon (IFN)-gamma after reactivation. IFN-gamma production was observed from both CD45RO+ and CD45RA+ Treg populations.

CONCLUSIONS:The results support the feasibility of isolating Tregs for in vitro expansion. Based on expansion capacity, FOXP3 stability, and functional properties, the CD4+CD127(lo/-)CD25+ T-cells represent a viable cell population for cellular therapy in this autoimmune disease.},

Earlier studies have suggested altered nitric oxide (NO) metabolism in both T1D and T2D. In the present case-control study, we investigated whether the endothelial NO synthase gene intron 4 a/b polymorphism is associated with T1D and T2D in the island of Crete, a well-defined area with genetically homogeneous population. Mutated allele ``a'' was more common in individuals with both T1D and T2D than in controls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06--2.77, p = 0.013; and OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.930--2.42, p = 0.047, respectively). Mutated genotype (a/a or a/b) was more common in individuals with T1D than in nondiabetic individuals (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.12--3.32, p = 0.008); this increased frequency was also observed for T2D, although not at a significant level (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 0.802--2.37). No difference was found in the frequency of mutated allele a or mutated genotype (a/a or a/b) between T1D and T2D populations. In conclusion, our results indicate that allele a of the intron 4 endothelial NO synthase gene is associated with susceptibility to both T1D and T2D and may represent a common genetic factor for diabetes.},

In this review, we intend to review the state-of-the-art knowledge on CB-SCs characteristics and function as well as immunological and regenerative properties. We report an itemized classification of CB-SCs populations, which is important to better understand which tissues can be replaced using CB-SCs and how the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from CB-SCs is changing the field. Furthermore, we will discuss new findings on the immunosuppressive capability of CB-SCs in autoimmune disease (e.g., type 1 diabetes). Our review will demonstrate how CB-SCs could become a powerful tool not only for regenerative medicine but for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases as well.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by T-cell mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Recently, small cationic $\alpha$-defensin molecules have been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess the $\alpha$-defensin expression in patients with T1D and elucidate the cellular source of their production. Our results show that 30% of patients exhibit increased levels of $\alpha$-defensin mRNAs in their capillary blood. Quantitative RT-PCR performed on FACS-sorted granulocytes identified CD15dull/CD14weak population as the cellular source of $\alpha$-defensins. Surprisingly, this granulocyte subpopulation displayed augmentation of $\alpha$-defensin expression in all T1D patients tested. The determination of cell surface markers, expression of cell-specific genes and confocal microscopy identified CD15dull/CD14weak cells as eosinophils. The presence of transcriptionally active eosinophils in diabetic patients suggests that eosinophils could be a part of an intricate innate immune cellular network involved in the development of diabetes.},

The keystone of CD pathogenesis is an adaptive immune response orchestrated by the interplay between gluten and MHC class II HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 molecules. Yet, other factors that impair immunoregulatory mechanisms and/or activate the large population of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) are indispensable for driving tissue damage. Herein, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of the undesirable immune response initiated by gluten peptides. We show that CD is a model disease to decipher the role of MHC class II molecules in human immunopathology, to analyze the mechanisms that link tolerance to food proteins and autoimmunity, and to investigate how chronic activation of IEL can lead to T cell lymphomagenesis.},

abstract = {Both genetic predisposition and environmental factors participate in the etiology of Type-1 diabetes. To test the role of the microbial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as an environmental trigger of autoimmune diabetes, we employed transgenic (tg) BDC2.5/NOD mice that bear an islet-specific CD4+ T cell repertoire ({\&}gt;95%), but do not develop the spontaneous diabetes that typifies the NOD (nonobese diabetic) strain. LPS administration provoked diabetes in BDC2.5/NOD mice by their 16th week of age. However, LPS administration in NOD mice did not accelerate their diabetes. This finding indicates that the frequency of islet-specific T cells influences LPS-mediated diabetes. Furthermore, in vitro LPS-cultured splenocytes from BDC2.5/NOD and BDC2.5-$\mu$MT (B-cell-deficient) mice effectively transferred diabetes into immunodeficient NOD-scid/scid mice but not immunosufficient NOD mice. Therefore, B lymphocytes are not required for LPS-provoked autoimmune diabetes. Flow cytometric analysis then revealed that LPS-stimulation in vitro induced the expression of an IL-2 receptor (CD25) on CD4 T cells; this indicates that the activation of islet-specific T cells is a prerequisite to eliciting diabetes in this situation. Overall, these results point to microbial LPS as an etiopathogenic agent of autoimmune diabetes.},

Despite this, the function of PML bodies is still unknown. Direct and indirect evidence supports the hypothesis that PML bodies interact with specific genes or genomic loci. This includes the finding that the stability of PML bodies is affected by cell stress and changes in chromatin structure. PML bodies also facilitate the transcription and replication of double-stranded DNA viral genomes. Moreover, PML bodies associate with specific regions of high transcriptional activity in the cellular genome. We propose that PML bodies functionally interact with chromatin and are important for the regulation of gene expression.},

In vitro, EDl-positive macrophages were found to lyse pancreatic islet cells to a similar degree to various tumor cells but not normal thyrocytes.

abstract = {The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein has been implicated in many cellular pathways, but it is unclear whether the accumulation of PML and other proteins into PML nuclear bodies is a regulated or random process. In this paper we have used a variety of physiological stresses, including heat stress, Cd+2 exposure and adenovirus E1A expression, as tools to study the principles underlying the assembly/disassembly, integrity and dynamic behavior of PML bodies. Using live-cell imaging and immunofluorescence microscopy, we observe that PML bodies are positionally stable over time intervals of a few hours. After stress, however, microstructures form as a result of fission or budding from the surface of 'parental' PML bodies. Since new PML bodies do not form at new locations, and the relative sizes observed before heat shock are preserved after recovery, we conclude that there are pre-determined locations for PML bodies, and that they are not random accumulations of protein. Over-expression of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO-1) prevents stress-induced disassembly of PML bodies, implicating SUMO-1 as a key regulator of PML body integrity. Stress-induced fission of SUMO-1-deficient microstructures from parental PML bodies may be a mechanism to change local chromatin domain environments by the dispersal of protein factors. PML bodies may provide a useful paradigm for the dynamics and integrity of other supramolecular protein complexes involved in processes such as transcription, RNA processing DNA repair and replication.},

abstract = {This paper has reviewed, with somewhat variable coverage, the nine MR image segmentation techniques itemized in Table II. A wide array of approaches have been discussed; each has its merits and drawbacks. We have also given pointers to other approaches not discussed in depth in this review. The methods reviewed fall roughly into four model groups: c-means, maximum likelihood, neural networks, and k-nearest neighbor rules. Both supervised and unsupervised schemes require human intervention to obtain clinically useful results in MR segmentation. Unsupervised techniques require somewhat less interaction on a per patient/image basis. Maximum likelihood techniques have had some success, but are very susceptible to the choice of training region, which may need to be chosen slice by slice for even one patient. Generally, techniques that must assume an underlying statistical distribution of the data (such as LML and UML) do not appear promising, since tissue regions of interest do not usually obey the distributional tendencies of probability density functions. The most promising supervised techniques reviewed seem to be FF/NN methods that allow hidden layers to be configured as examples are presented to the system. An example of a self-configuring network, FF/CC, was also discussed. The relatively simple k-nearest neighbor rule algorithms (hard and fuzzy) have also shown promise in the supervised category. Unsupervised techniques based upon fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms have also shown great promise in MR image segmentation. Several unsupervised connectionist techniques have recently been experimented with on MR images of the brain and have provided promising initial results. A pixel-intensity-based edge detection algorithm has recently been used to provide promising segmentations of the brain. This is also an unsupervised technique, older versions of which have been susceptible to oversegmenting the image because of the lack of clear boundaries between tissue types or finding uninteresting boundaries between slightly different types of the same tissue. To conclude, we offer some remarks about improving MR segmentation techniques. The better unsupervised techniques are too slow. Improving speed via parallelization and optimization will improve their competitiveness with, e.g., the k-nn rule, which is the fastest technique covered in this review. Another area for development is dynamic cluster validity. Unsupervised methods need better ways to specify and adjust c, the number of tissue classes found by the algorithm. Initialization is a third important area of research. Many of the schemes listed in Table II are sensitive to good initialization, both in terms of the parameters of the design, as well as operator selection of training data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Induction of hematopoietic chimerism initiates tolerizing processes that often restore control over autoimmune reactions: graft versus autoimmunity reaction. In view of the limited capacity of autologous bone marrow transplants and some cases of persistent autoimmune diabetes after allogeneic transplants, we hypothesize that the preparative conditioning regimens adopted from the oncological setting are suboptimal approaches to rebooting the immune system. In general, homeostatic expansion under lymphopenic conditions favors the recovery and development of cytotoxic T cells. Autoimmune diabetes is a particular case in which debulking is ineffective due to resistance of the effector cells to depletion by conventional immunosuppressive therapies. Furthermore, resetting of immune activity is impaired by lymphopenia-induced proliferation of residual diabetogenic clones and delayed recovery of suppressor cells. For control of the autoimmune reaction it is essential to design immunomodulatory approaches that overcome rejection while avoiding homeostatic expansion of residual diabetogenic clones.},

Given prior studies of the B:9-23 insulin peptide in NOD mice, a fundamental question is whether the immune response to the B:9-23 peptide of the two insulins is identical. We investigate responses to the immunization with B:9-23 insulin 1 and 2 peptides in NOD and RIP-B7.1 Balb/c mice. NOD and F1 (Balb/c{\&}{\#}xa0;×{\&}{\#}xa0;C57/Bl6) B7.1 transgenic mice were given either B:9-23 insulin 1, B:9-23 insulin 2 or tetanus toxoid (TT) control peptide. Insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and anti-B:9-23 antibodies (IgG1 and IgG2c) were measured. Subcutaneous injection of the insulin 2 but not the insulin 1 peptide significantly protected NOD mice from diabetes. Conceptually similar, insulin 1 peptide immunization accelerated diabetes in the B7.1 mice compared with insulin 2 peptide. Insulin 1 and 2 peptides induced similar levels of IAA in the NOD mice except at week 26, where insulin 2 induced higher levels of IAA. Anti-IgG1 B:9-23 peptide antibodies were higher in the insulin 2 immunized group of NOD mice, while IgG2c anti-B:9-23 peptide antibodies were higher in the insulin 1 group. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from insulin 1 immunized mice to NOD.scid mice demonstrated accelerated diabetogenicity. The protection afforded by insulin 2 peptide but not insulin 1 peptide in the NOD mouse is reflected by its predominant Th2 humoral response. This may relate to the protection conferred by the insulin 1 knockout when bred onto NOD mice in contrast to acceleration of disease with an insulin 2 knockout.},

In addition to a lymphocytic infiltration (insulitis) of the islets, patients with IDDM have autoantibodies directed against the components of the islet cells. Several $\beta$-cell proteins have been identified as candidate autoantigens. The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a murine model for spontaneous IDDM. It is generally accepted that IDDM in patients and NOD mice results from the T lymphocyte-mediated destruction of $\beta$-cells. However, the direct role of B lymphocytes in the disease process has not yet been clarified. To test directly the role of B cells in IDDM, we have generated B cell-deficient NOD mice by backcrossing the $\mu$MT−/− B cell `knockout mice' onto the NOD background. The mice had no evidence of functional B cells as determined by flow cytometry and antibody production. We show that two out of seven of these mice developed insulitis and diabetes. These results suggest that despite an absence of B cells some NOD mice can still develop insulitis and diabetes.},

Until recently, cell nuclear architecture has largely been assessed by subjective visual inspection of fluorescently labeled components imaged by the optical microscope. This approach is inadequate to fully quantify spatial associations, especially when the patterns are indistinct, irregular, or highly punctate. Accurate image processing techniques as well as statistical and computational tools are thus necessary to interpret this data if meaningful spatial-function relationships are to be established. Here, we have developed a thresholding algorithm, stable count thresholding (SCT), to segment nuclear compartments in confocal laser scanning microscopy image stacks to facilitate objective and quantitative analysis of the three-dimensional organization of these objects using formal statistical methods. We validate the efficacy and performance of the SCT algorithm using real images of immunofluorescently stained nuclear compartments and fluorescent beads as well as simulated images. In all three cases, the SCT algorithm delivers a segmentation that is far better than standard thresholding methods, and more importantly, is comparable to manual thresholding results. By applying the SCT algorithm and statistical analysis, we quantify the spatial configuration of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies with respect to irregular-shaped SC35 domains. We show that the compartments are closer than expected under a null model for their spatial point distribution, and furthermore that their spatial association varies according to cell state. The methods reported are general and can readily be applied to quantify the spatial interactions of other nuclear compartments.},

Abnormalities in learning and memory, synaptic plasticity, and glutamatergic neurotransmission have now been identified in a number of these models. In general, observations in models characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia and hypoinsulinaemia (referred to as models of type 1 diabetes) are quite consistent, and these models are being increasingly used to study the pathogenesis and to develop new treatments. However, results from models characterized by insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia, and modest hyperglycaemia (referred to as models of type 2 diabetes) are much more variable. Moreover, the possible interaction between diabetes and aging has not been examined in sufficient detail. Because clinically relevant cognitive deficits mainly occur in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes, the challenge for researchers in this field will be to further develop adequate models.},

These findings have greatly increased our understanding of the genetic background of T1D and have encouraged the development of genetic tools for mapping complex diseases. Here we review the wealth of data on T1D and discuss the major genetic polymorphisms involved in the disease.

In this study, we investigated the effect of h-LT on the signal transduction of the mouse thymocytes by observing c-Fos expression in the thymocytes by using a flow cytometer. The intensity of c-Fos expression in whole thymocytes was significantly lower in the female NOD with a high incidence of diabetes than that in the male NOD mice with a low incidence of diabetes and than that in normal mice (P {\&}lt; 0.0001). The low c-Fos expression in the female NOD thymocytes was most prominent in CD3low thymocytes. c-Jun expression of the CD3low thymocytes was also lower in the female NOD mice. Administrations of h-LT, h-TNF, and h-IL-2, which has been reported to prevent IDDM in NOD mice by systemic administration, significantly up-regulated c-Fos expression in CD3low thymocytes. From these results, it is assumed that a relationship may exist between the high diabetes incidence and the defective c-Fos expression in female NOD mice and between the prevention of IDDM and the amelioration of the defective c-Fos expression with h-LT in female NOD mice.},

We explored the cellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of these autoimmune responses by investigations involving various gene-deficient mice on the NOD background. Administration of blocking anti-PDL1 antibody to CD4+ T cell-deficient, CD8+ T cell-deficient and B cell-deficient mice demonstrated that PDL1-mediated regulation of autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is critical for diabetes development. This concept was confirmed by adoptive transfer studies utilizing lymphocytes from BDC2.5 and 4.1 (CD4+) TCR transgenic mice and 8.3 (CD8+) TCR transgenic mice; efforts showing increased proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells following PDL1 blockade in vivo. Furthermore, we observed that anti-PDL1-mediated acceleration is dependent upon events occurring in the pancreatic lymph nodes during early disease stages, but becomes independent of the pancreatic lymph nodes during later disease stages. These data provide strong evidence that PDL1 regulates autoimmune diabetes by limiting the expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ autoreactive T cells, and define the timing and locale of PDL1-mediated regulation of type 1 diabetes.},

We found that nitrotyrosine, a biochemical marker of oxidant stress, was higher in the NOD aortae when compared to age-matched non-autoimmune BALB/c controls or the diabetes-resistant NOD congenic strain, NOD.Lc7. The oxidant stress was localized to the intimal and medial layers, and endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine was decreased in isolated aortic rings from NOD mice. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis caused an endothelium-dependent contraction, and treatment with either a selective thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor antagonist or a non-isozyme-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor reversed this effect. Aortic rings from NOD.Lc7 did not display the paradoxical vasoconstriction. Furthermore, the vascular dysfunction was caused by oxidative stress, as treatment with a superoxide dismutase mimetic in vivo or with native antioxidant enzymes ex vivo inhibited the tissue oxidant stress and restored endothelium-dependent relaxation. Endothelial function was also restored by the inhibitors of NAD(P)H oxidase, diphenylene iodonium or apocynin. Our studies indicate that an oxidant stress that occurs prior to the onset of diabetes in this mouse model contributes to endothelial dysfunction independently of overt diabetes.},

We found that NKT cell-specific receptor (NKT-TCR) V$\alpha$14J$\alpha$281 expressions by quantitative (RealTime) RT-PCR in thymus, spleen and liver of NOD male and female mice were low at 1--3 months of life compared to BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, albeit a transient spike in levels occurred in female NOD livers at 2 months. Female pancreases showed low levels of these transcripts despite their active and destructive insulitis. In contrast, NOD males exhibited high expression of this invariant TCR in pancreas, where their insulitis was less destructive. A survey of NKT-TCR expressions in a battery of congenic, non-diabetes prone NOD strains indicated that this NKT phenotype was quite variable but higher than diabetes prone NOD. Bone marrow transplantation of NOD females from B6.NOD-H2g7 donors raised their NKT-TCR expressions. Tuberculin administrations in the forms of BCG and CFA in a manner known to protect NOD mice from diabetes both raised NKT-TCR levels, as did the anti-inflammatory PPAR-$\gamma$ agonist rosiglitazone. These findings provide exciting therapeutic avenues to be explored in the treatment of human immune mediated type-1 diabetes where there are similar immunoregulatory lesions.},

abstract = {The relative efficiencies of allogeneic and syngeneic bone marrow transplantation and the threshold levels of donor chimerism required to control autoimmune insulitis were evaluated in prediabetic NOD mice. Male and female NOD mice were conditioned by radiation and grafted with bone marrow cells from allogeneic and syngeneic sex-mismatched donors. Establishment of full allogeneic chimerism in peripheral blood reversed insulitis and restored glucose tolerance despite persistence of residual host immune cells. By contrast, sublethal total body irradiation (with or without syngeneic transplant) reduced the incidence and delayed the onset of diabetes. The latter pattern was also seen in mice that rejected the bone marrow allografts. Low levels of stable allogeneic hematopoietic chimerism ({\&}gt;1%) were sufficient to prevent the evolution of diabetes following allogeneic transplantation. The data indicate that immunomodulation attained at low levels of allogeneic, but not syngeneic, hematopoietic chimerism is effective in resolution of islet inflammation at even relatively late stages in the evolution of the prediabetic state in a preclinical model. However, our data question the efficacy and rationale behind syngeneic (autologous-like) immuno-hematopoietic reconstitution in type 1 diabetes.},

abstract = {Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease. Many studies and observations suggest that it could be caused by an immune reaction against autoantigens at the endothelial level, the most relevant of which are oxidized LDL and heat shock proteins (HSP) 60/65. Endothelial dysfunction plays a fundamental role. The first antigen is related to the increased leakage and oxidation of LDL; the second to cellular reaction to stress. Experimental and clinical observations confirm the pathogenetic role of these antigens. Both innate and adaptive immunity and impaired regulatory mechanisms of the autoimmune reaction are involved. Different triggering factors are examined: infectious agents, smoking, air pollution, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. Analogies and differences between systemic atherosclerosis and transplant-related coronary atherosclerosis help to understand their respective nature. Immune mechanisms might be responsible for the passage from stable plaque to unstable and rupture-prone plaque. Finally, prospects of treatment and prevention are linked to the induction of tolerance to responsible antigens, activation of immune regulatory response and the use of immunomodulatory drugs.},

However, lowering copper levels to below normal levels with tetrathiomolybdate has been found to have efficacy in cancer, probably by turning down signaling by angiogenic cytokines. More recently, we have shown in animals models that tetrathiomolybdate dramatically inhibits pulmonary and liver fibrosis. In other animal models, we have shown that the drug also inhibits liver damage from concanavalin A and acetaminophen, and heart damage from doxorubicin. These studies are briefly reviewed, and we then present data on tetrathiomolybdate's partially protective effect against diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice, an autoimmune model of type I diabetes. Possible mechanisms of tetrathiomolybdate's protective effect are briefly considered.},

abstract = {Summary The development of spontaneous insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is preceded by the organization of tertiary lymphoid organ (TLO) in situ, but its role in the development of tissue destruction and the cytokines that control such structures have not been fully defined. We have now observed that TNF superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) is upregulated in aged nonobese diabetic (NOD) pancreas with the appearance of TLO. Blockade of TNFSF14 signaling caused a substantial reduction in the expression of lymphotoxin $\beta$ receptor (LT$\beta$R)-controlled migration factors within the islets and disrupts organization of tertiary structures, leading to prevention of diabetes. Consistently, enhancing LT$\beta$R signaling by transgenic expression of TNFSF14 in the islets of NOD mice rapidly promoted de novo formation of local TLO, resulting in diabetes, even in the absence of draining lymph nodes (LN). Thus, the TNFSF14-LT$\beta$R pathway appears to be critical in the development and maintenance of TLO for the onset of diabetes.},

abstract = {With the aim of clarifying the mechanism of the suppressive action of BCG against insulitis and overt diabetes in NOD mice, we studied the effects of BCG on spleen cell populations and on the in vitro immune responses of spleen cells. The spleen cells of BCG-vaccinated mice showed much lower responsiveness to various mitogens such as Con A, PHA, PWM, and LPS than those of saline-treated mice. Low responsiveness to alloantigens was also observed. Flow cytometric analysis of the spleen cells revealed that Mac-1+ and Mac-2+ cells had increased while T and B cells had decreased in the BCG-vaccinated mice compared with the saline-treated mice at the time when the maximum level of inhibition of mitogen responses of BCG-vaccinated mice was observed. This suggests that the decreased in vitro immune response was due to the increase in macrophages which suppress lymphocyte functions. Support for this interpretation comes from the following two findings: (1) the restoration of mitogen responses of spleen cells when macrophages were eliminated by plastic adhesion or FACS sorting and (2) resuppression of PHA and Con A responses of plastic-nonadherent spleen cells by addition of adherent cells or flow cytometrically sorted Mac-1+ cells obtained from BCG-vaccinated mice. These results indicate the generation of suppressor macrophages after BCG vaccination and suggest that these macrophages prevent the autoimmune pathogenesis leading to diabetes in NOD mice.},

abstract = {Summary Chronic viral infections of the hematopoietic system are associated with bone marrow dysfunction, to which both virus-mediated and immune-mediated effects may contribute. Using unresolving noncytopathic Friend virus (FV) infection in mice, we showed that unregulated CD4+ T cell response to FV caused IFN-$\gamma$-mediated bone marrow pathology and anemia. Importantly, bone marrow pathology was triggered by relative insufficiency in regulatory T (Treg) cells and was prevented by added Treg cells, which suppressed the local IFN-$\gamma$ production by FV-specific CD4+ T cells. We further showed that the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of transgenic Treg cells expressing the $\beta$ chain of an FV-specific TCR was virtually devoid of FV-specific clones. Moreover, anemia induction by virus-specific CD4+ T cells was efficiently suppressed by virus-nonspecific Treg cells. Thus, sufficient numbers of polyclonal Treg cells may provide substantial protection against bone marrow pathology in chronic viral infections.},

The rigorous definition of an autoimmune disease requires evidence that an autoantigen elicits pathological immune responses. Using criteria for the pathogenicity of an autoantigen, we examine the evidence for proinsulin as an autoantigen in T1D. We conclude that proinsulin satisfies these criteria. As a corollary, proinsulin is a potential immunotherapeutic tool for the prevention of T1D.},

abstract = {Antibodies to ICA512/IA-2 are a well established marker of human IDDM and can be detected prior to and soon after the onset of insulin dependency. The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse and the diabetes-prone BB rat develop spontaneous diabetes as a consequence of T-cell mediated autoimmune destruction of islet $\beta$-cells, but the occurrence of autoantibodies is contro-versial. We tested sera from NOD mice and BB-rats for anti-ICA512 by a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIP). In sequential serum samples from 20 NOD mice, of which 15 developed diabetes, low levels of anti-ICA512 were demonstrable. Anti-ICA512 appeared close to the onset of hyperglycaemia and was usually transient. Non-diabetic NOD mice also produced anti-ICA512, but at a later age and at lower levels than the diabetic NOD mice. In a cross-sectional analysis of sera from BB rats, low levels of anti-ICA512 were present in 11/20 (55%) of non-diabetic-diabetes prone (DP) BB rats, 0/4 (0%) of diabetic DP BB rats, and 1/6 (17%) of diabetes-resistant BB rats. Anti-ICA512 was not detected in rats of other strains, including three Sprague-Dawley rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. In both NOD mice and BB rats the anti-ICA512 reactivity was directed to the cytoplasmic domain of the protein. The transient appearance of anti-ICA512 close to the onset of diabetes in NOD mice and the loss of these antibodies after diabetes onset is consistent with the occurrence of anti-ICA512 in human IDDM. Thus in both human IDDM and rodent models, anti-ICA512 is a marker of the impending onset of diabetes and disappears after diabetes onset.},

The population at risk was all 0--14 year-old inhabitants. Patients were identified from five sources: hospitals, primary assistance, endocrinologists, diabetic associations and diabetes camps. The degree of ascertainment was 98.93%. HLA genetic study was performed. Annual incidence was 16.4 per 100,000 per year (95% CI: 14.7--18.2). This incidence was significantly higher in males than in females, 18.7 versus 14.2 (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.02), and increased with age. The haplotypes (DR3)-DQB1*0201/(DR4)-DQB1*0302 and (DR3)-DQB1*0201/(DR7)-DQB1*0202 conferred the highest risk of type 1 diabetes. A relative high incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus has been demonstrated in the Northeast of Spain, and it does not support south-to-north incidence gradient in Europe. Haplotypes that conferred a higher risk of disease agree with those founded in other Caucasic populations.},

We adoptively transferred islet antigen-specific T cell clones into NOD and transgenic NOD.Eadmice to evaluate the level of protection provided by I-E expression against activated effector T cells. We have found that neither neonatal or 3--5-week-old I-E-expressing NOD.Eadmice can completely inhibit the diabetogenic activities of activated islet antigen-specific T cell clones. These data indicate that E$\alpha$ protein expression in NOD antigen presenting cells (APC) does not reduce islet autoantigen presentation in the context of I-Ag7below the threshold required for stimulation of effector/memory diabetogenic T cells. Our results suggest that the mechanism of E$\alpha$ protein-mediated diabetes resistance in NOD mice may be ``antigen ignorance,'' in which the quantity of islet autoantigens presented in the context of I-Ag7by APC is reduced below the threshold required to activate naı̈ve islet antigen-specific T cells.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is one of the more costly chronic diseases of children and adolescents throughout North America and Europe, exhibiting an average estimated prevalence rate of nearly 0.2%. It occurs in genetically predisposed individuals when the immune system attacks and destroys specifically the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. While routine insulin therapy can provide diabetic patients with their daily insulin requirements, non-compliance and undetected hyperglycemic excursions often lead to subsequent long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications. The only real cure for type 1 diabetes is replacement of the beta cell mass, currently being accomplished through ecto-pancreatic transplantation and islet implantation. Both of these procedures suffer from a chronic shortage of available donor tissue in comparison to the number of potential recipients. To circumvent this need, three alternative approaches are being intensively investigated: (1) the production of surrogate cells by genetically modifying non-endocrine cells to secrete insulin in response to glucose challenge; (2) the trans-differentiation of non-endocrine stem/progenitor cells or mature cells to glucose-responsive adult tissue; and (3) the regulated differentiation of islet stem/progenitor cells to produce large numbers of mature, functional islets. In recent years, each of these approaches has made impressive advances, leading to the most important question, `how soon will this new science be available to the patient?' In the present review, we discuss some of the recent advances, focusing primarily on the differentiation of islet stem cells to functional endocrine pancreas that may form the basis for future treatment.},

abstract = {The hallmark of immune-mediated type 1 diabetes is T cell-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing $\beta$ cells in the islets, which results from an imbalance between disease promoting factors and protective elements. The precise mechanisms of $\beta$ cell destruction leading to diabetes remain unclear. There are many molecules, including Fas ligand (FasL) and cytokines, such as IL-1, TNF-$\alpha$ and IFN-$\gamma$ that cause release of other cytokine-mediators that have potential to damage the $\beta$ cells. The $\beta$ cell-death appears to ultimately be caused by receptor (Fas/FasL)-mediated mechanisms and/or by secretion of cytotoxic molecules (e.g., granzymes, perforin). FasL-mediated $\beta$ cell damage might play a role in promoting insulitis and $\beta$ cell destruction in autoimmune diabetes in addition to toxic molecules, such as reactive oxygen species (superoxide, hydroxy radical, nitric oxide) or perforin. Furthermore, DNA damage in $\beta$ cells leads to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-activation which will increase NAD consumption and rapid depletion of NAD compromise ATP production in the cells. Nicotinamide inhibits poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and reduces nitric oxide accumulation in the NOD pancreas and protect $\beta$ cells against radical-induced necrosis. Transgenic mice with $\beta$ cell specific overexpression of copper, zinc superoxide dismutase, or thioredoxin are resistant to autoimmune and STZ-induced diabetes. It is apparent that a number of different mechanisms of $\beta$ cell destruction are operative in type 1 diabetes. Blockage of multiple pathways, rather than a single pathway, of $\beta$ cell-death may, therefore be necessary to fully protect $\beta$ cells from destruction and thereby prevent type 1 diabetes.},

The underlying mechanisms driving the activation and differentiation of these proinflammatory T cells are unknown. We examined the monocytes isolated directly from the blood of T1D patients and found they spontaneously secreted the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6, which are known to induce and expand Th17 cells. Moreover, these in vivo-activated monocytes from T1D subjects induced more IL-17-secreting cells from memory T cells compared with monocytes from healthy control subjects. The induction of IL-17-secreting T cells by monocytes from T1D subjects was reduced in vitro with a combination of an IL-6-blocking Ab and IL-1R antagonist. In this study, we report a significant although modest increase in the frequency of IL-17-secreting cells in lymphocytes from long-term patients with T1D compared with healthy controls. These data suggest that the innate immune system in T1D may drive the adaptive immune system by expanding the Th17 population of effector T cells.},

abstract = {The protein Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) is a Ras-like small GTPase that activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which promotes cell growth. We previously generated transgenic C57BL/6 mice overexpressing Rheb in $\beta$-cells (B6Rheb), which exhibited increased $\beta$-cell size and improved glucose tolerance with higher insulin secretion than wild type C57BL/6 mice. The mice also showed resistance to obesity-induced hyperglycemia, a model of type 2 diabetes, and to multiple low-dose-streptozotocin (MLDS)-induced hyperglycemia, a model of type 1 diabetes (T1D). To investigate whether the effects of mTORC1 activation by Rheb in B6Rheb mice would also be evident in NOD mice, a spontaneous autoimmune T1D model, we created two NOD mouse lines overexpressing Rheb in their $\beta$-cells (NODRheb; R3 and R20). We verified Rheb overexpression in $\beta$-cells, the relative activation of mTORC1 and $\beta$-cell enlargement. By 35{\&}{\#}xa0;weeks of age, diabetes incidence was significantly greater in the R3 line and tended to be greater in the R20 line than in NOD mice. Histological analysis demonstrated that insulitis was significantly accelerated in 12-week-old R3 NODRheb mice compared with NOD mice. Furthermore, serum insulin autoantibody (IAA) expression was significantly higher than that of NOD mice. We also examined whether complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) treatment alone or with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog would reverse the hyperglycemia of NODRheb mice; unexpectedly, almost none achieved normoglycemia. In summary, diabetes progression was significantly accelerated rather than prevented in NODRheb mice. Our results suggest that the $\beta$-cell enlargement might merely enhance the autoimmunity of pathogenic T-cells against islets, leading to acceleration of autoimmune diabetes. We conclude that not only enlargement but also regeneration of $\beta$-cells in addition to the prevention of $\beta$-cell destruction will be required for the ideal therapy of autoimmune T1D.},

TG+ subjects self-selected to gluten-free or gluten-containing diet. Results Of the initial cohort, 80% were available for reexamination after 2 years. TG+ subjects had consistently lower weight z-scores and higher urine N-telopeptides than TG− subjects, but similar measures of bone density and diabetes outcomes. TG+ children who remained on a gluten-containing diet had lower insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 z-scores compared with TG+ subjects who reported following a gluten-free diet. Children who continued with high TG index throughout the study had lower bone mineral density z-scores, ferritin, and vitamin D 25OH levels, compared with the TG- group. Conclusions No significant adverse outcomes were identified in children with T1D with screening-identified TG+ who delay therapy with a gluten-free diet for 2 years. Children with persistently high levels of TG may be at greater risk. The optimal timing of screening and treatment for celiac disease in children with T1D requires further investigation.},

V$\alpha$14 Natural killer (NKT) cells are a unique lymphocyte subtype implicated in the regulation of autoimmunity and a good source of protective Th2 cytokines. We recently developed a Th2-skewing NKT cell ligand, OCH. OCH, a sphingosine truncated derivative of $\alpha$-galactosylceramide ($\alpha$-GC), stimulates NKT cells to selectively produce Th2 cytokines. Here we show that OCH prevented the development of diabetes and insulitis in NOD mice. The suppression of insulitis by OCH was more profound compared to $\alpha$-GC. Infiltration of T cells, B cells and macrophages into islets is inhibited in OCH-treated NOD mice. OCH-mediated suppression of diabetes is associated with Th2 bias of anti-islet antigen response and increased IL-10 producing cells among islet-infiltrating leukocytes. Considering the non-polymorphic and well conserved features of the CD1d molecule in mice and humans, these findings not only support the proposed role of NKT cells in the regulation of self-tolerance but also highlight the potential use of OCH for therapeutic intervention in type I diabetes.},

Thymic regulatory T (Treg) cell generation in vivo was directly correlated with in vitro TCR reactivity to OVA-peptide in a broad ∼1,000-fold range. Interestingly, higher TCR affinity was associated with a larger Treg cell developmental ``niche'' size, even though the amount of antigen should remain constant. The TCR-reactivity threshold to elicit thymic negative selection and peripheral T cell responses was ∼100-fold higher than that of Treg cell differentiation. Thus, these data suggest that the broad range of self-reactivity that elicits thymic Treg cell generation is tuned to secure peripheral tolerance to self.},

Main obstacles are the contradictory findings in different model systems, as well as the contrasting functions of regulatory lymphocytes and cytokines. By drawing examples primarily from experimental type 1 diabetes, we propose that regulatory cells and cytokines can be classified according to the baseline at which they operate in healthy individuals and disease states that are not accompanied by severe systemic immune deficiency or skewing. Consequently, deletion or neutralization of regulatory cells or cytokines operative at high levels to maintain systemic homeostasis should constitute a therapeutic strategy for immune enhancement (e.g. tumor- and pathogen-specific immunity), whereas boosting these factors will have limited effects if the therapeutic goal is a downmodulation of immune responses (e.g. autoimmunity). Conversely, regulatory cells and cytokines operative at low homeostatic levels should unfold therapeutic capacities by further embellishment but not additional reduction.},

Deletion of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (Pdk1) in T cells via Cd4-Cre induced chronic inflammation of the intestine despite the importance of PDK1 in T cell activation. Analysis of colonic intraepithelial lymphocytes of PDK1-deficient mice revealed markedly increased CD8$\alpha$+ T cell receptor (TCR)$\gamma$$\delta$+ T cells, including an interleukin-17 (IL-17)-expressing population. TCR$\gamma$$\delta$+ T cells were responsible for the inflammatory colitis as shown by the fact that deletion of Tcrd abolished spontaneous colitis in the PDK1-deficient mice. This dysregulation of intestinal TCR$\gamma$$\delta$+ T cells was attributable to a reduction in the number and functional capacity of PDK1-deficient T regulatory (Treg) cells. Adoptive transfer of wild-type Treg cells abrogated the spontaneous activation and proliferation of intestinal TCR$\gamma$$\delta$+ T cells observed in PDK1-deficient mice and prevented the development of colitis. Therefore, suppression of intestinal TCR$\gamma$$\delta$+ T cells by Treg cells maintains enteric immune tolerance.},

abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine and ablation of IL-10 exacerbates Th1-type autoimmune diseases. Even though type 1 diabetes (T1D) in NOD mice is believed to be Th1-mediated, the incidence and severity of T1D is unaltered in IL-10-deficient NOD mice raised under pathogen-free conditions. We describe for the first time, the outcome of IL-10 deficiency on islet and other organ-specific autoimmunity in NOD mice raised in a conventional facility. IL-10-deficient NOD mice under such conditions were protected from spontaneous as well as cyclophosphamide-induced diabetes, but were susceptible to diabetes induced by adoptive transfer of splenocytes from spontaneously diabetic NOD mice. Whereas the incidence of rectal prolapse was very high in this NOD.IL-10−/− mouse colony, IL-10-deficient C57Bl/6 mice raised under similar conditions seldom developed rectal prolapse. While injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) significantly reduced insulitis, it did not ameliorate colitis in IL-10-deficient NOD mice indicating differential regulation of organ-specific autoimmunity by CFA. Phenotypic characterization of IL-10−/− mice revealed a significant increase in splenic macrophage numbers in NOD but not on the B6 background. This was accompanied by a heightened systemic inflammatory cytokine response and mortality following in vivo challenge with a toll-like receptor 9 agonist, CpG-containing DNA.},

abstract = {Diabetes in NOD mice is an autoimmune disease similar to Type I diabetes in humans. Prior to hypoglycemia, changes in the islet infiltrate led to autoreactive T cell activation and destruction of the insulin-producing $\beta$ cells. If T cell activation can be inhibited before $\beta$ cell destruction is complete, islet cell rescue and regeneration can occur. Female NOD mice {\&}gt;100 days old with blood glucose levels {\&}gt;20 mM/l for less than 7 days were selected as `recent onset' mice. Untreated, all of these animals would die of diabetes in {\&}lt;40 days. Mice treated with anti-CD4 (GK1.5) achieved 14.3% permanent remission, while those treated with anti-CD8 (53.6.7) showed 33.3% permanent remission. Mice treated with anti-CD3 (145-2C11) also achieved 33.3% permanent remission, but 14% of these died of first dose syndrome. In mice treated with a low dose of anti-CD3 (10 $\mu$g KT3), which did not induce first dose syndrome, 50% remained in remission for {\&}gt;100 days. This dose of mAb reduced insulitis but did not deplete splenic CD3 cells. When mice in remission were challenged with a vascularized pancreas isograft at 50 days, 9/22 remained normal and 13/22 had recurrent disease in both transplanted and native pancreas. Of the long-surviving isografts 7/9 were in KT3 treated recipients. Histology showed activated T cell infiltration in the native and transplanted pancreases of mice with transient remission. Benign insulitis with macrophages, B cells, CD4{\&}gt;CD8 T cells and low levels of IL-2R, IL-2, IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-4 was seen in islets from the native pancreas and in long surviving pancreas isografts in mice that remained in remission. Thus, using low dose KT3, it was possible to halt the development of diabetes in 50% of animals treated soon after diagnosis, despite significant islet cell destruction at this stage. Of the KT3 treated mice in permanent remission, 70% had re-established tolerance to autoantigen and did not destroy vascularized pancreas isografts.},

The islet antigen-specific T cell response of ins-TGF-$\beta$1 mice relied on different antigen-presenting cells (APC) from those used by NOD T cells. T cells from NOD mice utilized B cells to present islet antigen, whereas T cells from ins-TGF-$\beta$1 mice utilized macrophages. In addition, the islet antigen-specific T cell repertoire of ins-TGF-$\beta$1 mice was distinct and deviated toward an IL-4-producing Th2 phenotype. When ins-TGF-$\beta$1 mice were treated with anti-IL-4 antibody, islet antigen-specific IFN$\gamma$-producing Th1 cells were unleashed, and the incidence of diabetes increased to the level of NOD mice. This suggests active suppression of a diabetogenic T cell response. This study describes a novel mechanism in which expression of TGF-$\beta$1 in the context of self-antigen shifts APC preference, deviating T cell responses to a Th2 phenotype, preventing IDDM.},

Intravenous injection of ins1 or 2B:9-23 significantly delayed the development of diabetes on the corresponding peptide-induced EAD (ins1EAD or ins2EAD) concomitant with reduced insulitis and insulin autoantibodies expression. Population of Foxp3+ CD4+ T cell was unchanged whereas the level of anti-insB:9-23 specific IgG2a but not IgG1 were specifically decreased, suggesting reduction of pathogenic insB:9-23 reactive T cells. Most interestingly, intravenous administration of ins2B:9-23, whose amino acid sequence had one amino acid difference at position 9 delayed the development of diabetes in both ins1EAD and ins2EAD whereas ins1B:9-23 administration delayed diabetes in the ins1EAD but not ins2EAD, suggesting that one amino acid difference gives critical influence on the effect of intravenous injection of antigenic peptide for type 1 diabetes.},

These factors are known to alter the beta-cell function and disturb its homeostasis, i.e. qualitative and quantitative changes in its activity. This can lead to disturbed glucose homeostasis and thereby diabetes. It is possible to stop this vicious cycle and reduce the incidence of diabetes by restoring the homeostasis of beta-cell function through proper diabetes management and maintainance of an appropriate dietary milieu. It has been suggested that beta-cell dysfunction or even death occurs by oxyradical mediated processes. Adequate stimulation of beta cells through high carbohydrate and fibre intake, and reduced oxidative tone by caloric restriction (low protein and saturated fat), supplementation with antioxidants (vitamin E and D) and polyunsaturated essential fatty acids may prevent loss or even restore the beta-cell activity from environmental diabetogenic insults.},

abstract = {CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) can rapidly kill $\beta$-cells and therefore contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D). CTL-mediated $\beta$-cell killing can occur via perforin-mediated lysis, Fas--Fas-L interaction, and the secretion of TNF-$\alpha$ or IFN-$\gamma$. The secretion of IFN-$\gamma$ can contribute to $\beta$-cell death directly by eliciting nitric oxide production, and indirectly by upregulating MHC class I and `unmasking' $\beta$-cells for recognition by CTL. Earlier studies in the RIP-LCMV mouse model of diabetes showed that disruption of $\beta$-cell IFN-$\gamma$ signaling alone abolished the direct detrimental effects of IFN-$\gamma$, but not MHC class I upregulation. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) represses several crucial cytokine signaling pathways simultaneously, among them IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-1-$\beta$. We therefore evaluated the protective capacity of islet cell SOCS-1 expression in the CD8+ mediated RIP-LCMV diabetes model. Clinical disease was prevented in over 90% of the mice. Not only absence of MHC-I and Fas upregulation, but also resistance to cytokine-induced killing of $\beta$-cells and a complete lack of CXCL-10 (IP10) production in islets led to a lack of islet infiltration and impaired activation of autoaggressive CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in these mice. Thus, SOCS expression renders $\beta$-cells resistant to CTL attack in a mouse model of T1D.},

abstract = {The ectoenzyme ADP-ribosyltransferase 2.2 (ART2.2) can apoptotically delete various T-cell subsets. Depending on the involved apoptotic T-cell subset, enhanced ART2.2 activity could result in immunosuppression or autoimmunity. Diminished activity of the CD38 ectoenzyme that normally represents a counter-regulatory competitor for the NAD substrate represents one mechanism enhancing ART2.2 activity. Hence, it would be desirable to develop an agent that efficiently blocks ART2.2 activity in vivo. While the llama derived recombinant s+16 single domain antibody overcame the difficulty of specifically targeting the ART2.2 catalytic site potential therapeutic use of this reagent is limited due to short in vivo persistence. Thus, we tested if a modified version of s+16 incorporating the murine IgG1 Fc tail (s+16Fc) mediated long-term efficient in vivo suppression of ART2.2. We reasoned an ideal model to test the s+16Fc reagent were NOD mice in which genetic ablation of CD38 results in an ART2.2 mediated reduction in already sub-normal numbers of immunoregulatory natural killer T-(NKT) cells to a level that no longer allows them when activated by the super-agonist alpha-galactosylceramide ($\alpha$-GalCer) to elicit effects inhibiting autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) development. Treatment with s+16Fc efficiently mediated long-term in vivo inhibition of ART2.2 activity in NOD.CD38null mice, restoring their iNKT cell numbers to levels that upon $\alpha$-GalCer activation were capable of inhibiting T1D development.},

We found that the glomeruli of diabetic NOD mice were infiltrated with T and B cells, as well as CD11c+ dendritic cells, which had close contact with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the infiltrates. We also found that IgG deposits in the glomeruli of diabetic NOD mice were accompanied by the presence of complement C3. Moreover, the serum from diabetic mice contained autoantibodies directed towards components of the glomeruli and these antibodies were not present in non-diabetic NOD mice. The immune changes in the kidney occurred together with increasing kidney weight and urinary albumin excretion along with duration of diabetes. We provide evidence that infiltrating lymphocytes and anti-kidney autoantibodies may be involved in diabetic nephropathy in autoimmune diabetes in the NOD mouse. Understanding the role that the immune system plays in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy could lead to identification of new strategies and/or additional therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy.},

However, we recently discovered a positive correlation between anti-P277 autoantibodies and the presence of endothelial cells damage in inducing vascular leak syndrome. Therefore, the aim of our study was to demonstrate the critical peptide epitope of P277 to IDDM and to highlight the effects of this peptide therapy on inflammation of the islets. Groups of 4-week old female non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice were immunized one time every three weeks for three times with a residue of P277, showing a significant effect of down-regulating immunity to P277 protein and preventing the development of IDDM. Immunologic results including the suppression of T-cell proliferation, the increase of interleukin-10 (IL-10) production and reduction of interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$) production caused immune tolerance to P277. Hence, a functional role of the key epitope in P277 peptide capable of preventing IDDM is suggested, which could be modified to develop a novel safe and effective peptide vaccine against IDDM by reconstructing P277 in the further studies.},

We showed that a well-characterized Foxp3gfp reporter mouse, which expresses an N-terminal GFP-Foxp3 fusion protein, is a hypomorph that causes profoundly accelerated autoimmune diabetes on a NOD background. Although natural Treg cell development and in vitro function are not markedly altered in Foxp3gfp NOD and C57BL/6 mice, Treg cell function in inflammatory environments was perturbed and TGF-$\beta$-induced Treg cell development was reduced. Foxp3gfp was unable to interact with the histone acetyltransferase Tip60, the histone deacetylase HDAC7, and the Ikaros family zinc finger 4, Eos, which led to reduced Foxp3 acetylation and enhanced K48-linked polyubiquitylation. Collectively this results in an altered transcriptional landscape and reduced Foxp3-mediated gene repression, notably at the hallmark IL-2 promoter. Loss of controlled Foxp3-driven epigenetic modification leads to Treg cell insufficiency that enables autoimmunity in susceptible environments.},

To test the putative involvement of IL-18 gene polymorphism in predisposition to human type 1 diabetes, the SNPs at position --607 (C/A) and --137 (G/C) in the promoter region of IL-18 gene were analyzed by sequence-specific PCR in 116 patients with type 1 diabetes and 114 normal controls. A linkage disequilibrium found only three of the four possible haplotypes defined by these SNPs. The distribution of the IL-18 gene genotypes at position --607 was significantly different between patients with type 1 diabetes and normal controls (P=0.023). Furthermore, there was a significant increase in haplotype 1 (--607C/--137G) in the patients compared with controls (P=0.006). The association study of the susceptible CTLA-4 genotype (GG at nucleotide position 49 in exon 1) or HLA-DR4-DQB1∗0401 and type 1 diabetes showed that the predisposing IL-18 gene haplotype modulates the risk on CTLA-4 GG genotype, but not on HLA-DR4-DQB1∗0401 haplotype. Among subjects carrying the CTLA-4 GG genotype, the frequency of IL-18 haplotype 1 in patients with type 1 diabetes was significantly higher than that in controls (91% vs. 71%, P=0.012). However, IL-18 haplotype 1 was not frequent in patients who do not exhibit the CTLA-4 high-risk genotype. These results suggest that the IL-18 gene polymorphism is associated with a type 1 diabetes susceptibility, and there might be a gene--gene interaction between IL-18 gene with susceptible CTLA-4 gene.},

To evaluate the potential of this approach for treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), we have designed a cyclic peptide vaccine, DiavaX, from the third hypervariable region of the $\beta$-chain of the NOD mouse MHC class II I-Ag7. NOD mice were treated at 5 and 9 weeks of age with 100{\&}{\#}xa0;$\mu$g DiavaX emulsified in alum, a control peptide in alum, or alum alone. At the end of the study, 87% of alum treated mice had developed diabetes, compared with only 28% of DiavaX-treated mice. None of the control peptides, including a linear I-Ag7, a scrambled cyclic I-Ag7, or an analogous cyclic I-Aspeptide, reduced the incidence of diabetes, demonstrating that the protective effect of DiavaX is conformationally dependent and both allele- and sequence-specific. DiavaX treatment did not cause any general immune suppression, but did induce peptide-specific antibodies and memory T cells. DiavaX-induced protection from diabetes was associated with the maintenance of a non-destructive islet-associated autoimmune response. These data indicate that a conformationally constrained peptide from the disease-associated MHC represents a potential vaccine candidate for the prevention of clinical IDDM.},

The present report summarizes our investigations on the effect of Linomide on different functional T cell subsets in NOD mice analyzed according to their cytokine profile. Supernatants from cultured splenocytes and peritoneal cells taken from Linomide-treated mice contained lower levels of TNF$\alpha$, IL-1$\beta$, IFN$\gamma$ and IL-12 versus higher levels of IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10 in comparison with supernatants from cultures of untreated mice. Our results suggest that regulation of autoimmunity following oral Linomide administration in NOD mice induces a shift from Th1 to Th2 phenotype response, thereby preventing the development of diabetes by active cytokine-induced immunoregulation of T cell subsets, including downregulation of Th1 and upregulation of Th2.},

TGF$\beta$1 prevents abnormal T-cell activation through the modulation of Ca2+--calcineurin signaling in a Caenorhabditis elegans Sma and Drosophila Mad proteins (SMAD)3 and SMAD4-independent manner; however, in Treg cells, its effects are mediated, at least in part, through SMAD signaling. TGF$\beta$1 also acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and induces interleukin (IL)-17-producing pathogenic T-helper cells (Th IL-17 cells) synergistically during an inflammatory response in which IL-6 is produced.

We used these predictions to address several experimentally challenging questions, including the identification of tissue-specific transcriptional motifs and the discovery of potential miRNA regulation specific to particular tissues.

To investigate the contribution of cPLA2$\alpha$ to autoimmune diabetes, we established non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, an excellent model for human type 1 diabetes, deficient in cPLA2$\alpha$. These mice showed severe insulitis and a higher incidence of diabetes. In their macrophages, decreased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) induced by cPLA2$\alpha$ deficiency, and the increase in production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$ were observed. These results suggested that cPLA2$\alpha$ plays a protective role in progression of insulitis and development of autoimmune diabetes by suppression of TNF-$\alpha$ production from macrophages.},

abstract = {Lisofylline (LSF), a synthetic modified methylxanthine, was originally designed and tested as an agent to reduce mortality during serious infections associated with cancer chemotherapy. Experimental studies and several clinical trials showed that LSF inhibited the generation of phosphatidic acid and free fatty acids. LSF also blocked the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in oxidative tissue injury, in response to cancer chemotherapy and in experimental sepsis. Recent research has revealed a new potential to extend the therapeutic application of LSF especially for diabetes mellitus. These new studies demonstrate multiple actions of LSF in the regulation of immune cell function and autoimmune response by inhibition of IL-12 signalling and cytokine production. Supporting the new potential for LSF is the discovery of beneficial effects in protecting pancreatic $\beta$ cells and in preventing autoimmunity. In this article, these new observations about LSF are reviewed and a strategy proposed for using this compound in new clinical applications. LSF may, thus, have therapeutic value in the prevention of autoimmune disorders, including Type 1 diabetes, and autoimmune recurrence following islet transplantation, and in preservation of $\beta$ cell functional mass during islet isolation.},

abstract = {Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a disease that results from autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing $\beta$-cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. The autoimmune response against islet $\beta$-cells is believed to result from a disorder of immunoregulation. According to this concept, a T helper 1 (Th1) subset of T cells and their cytokine products, i.e. Type 1 cytokines---interleukin 2 (IL-2), interferon gamma (IFN$\gamma$), and tumor necrosis factor beta (TNF$\beta$), dominate over an immunoregulatory (suppressor) Th2 subset of T cells and their cytokine products, i.e. Type 2 cytokines---IL-4 and IL-10. This allows Type 1 cytokines to initiate a cascade of immune/inflammatory processes in the islet (insulitis), culminating in $\beta$-cell destruction. Type 1 cytokines activate (1) cytotoxic T cells that interact specifically with $\beta$-cells and destroy them, and (2) macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and TNF$\alpha$), and oxygen and nitrogen free radicals that are highly toxic to islet $\beta$-cells. Furthermore, the cytokines IL-1, TNF$\alpha$, and IFN$\gamma$ are cytotoxic to $\beta$-cells, in large part by inducing the formation of oxygen free radicals, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite in the $\beta$-cells themselves. Therefore, it would appear that prevention of islet $\beta$-cell destruction and IDDM should be aimed at stimulating the production and/or action of Type 2 cytokines, inhibiting the production and/or action of Type 1 cytokines, and inhibiting the production and/or action of oxygen and nitrogen free radicals in the pancreatic islets.},

We investigated whether MYO9B is associated with T1D. The three SNPs were genotyped in Dutch samples from 288 T1D patients and 1615 controls. The A allele of SNP rs2305767A{\&}gt;G showed some evidence of association with T1D (nominal p for genotype = 0.06; OR carrier = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.04--2.19), but not in British samples from 4301 case patients and 4706 controls (p = 0.53), or when the Dutch and UK data were pooled (N patients = 4582, N controls= 6224; Mantel--Hansel p = 0.83). Furthermore, the nonsynonymous rs1545620 C{\&}gt;A SNP that has been associated with the inflammatory bowel disease, showed no association with T1D in British case-control set (p = 0.57). We conclude that MYO9B might not be a strong determinant of T1D, although there was some association in our initial Dutch study. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of MYO9B in T1D.},

Two genome scans suggested additional susceptibility intervals and provided supporting evidence for several previously reported linkages. Other studies focused on the confirmation of linkage using multipoint sibpair analyses with densely spaced markers and multiethnic collections of families. Although significant and consistent linkage evidence was reported for the susceptibility intervals IDDM8 (on human chromosome 6q27), IDDM4 (on 11q) and IDDM5 (on 6q25), evidence for most other intervals varies in different data sets --- probably due to a weak effect of the disease genes, genetic heterogeneity or random variation. Linkage disequilibrium mapping has become an increasingly important tool for both the confirmation and fine-mapping of susceptibility intervals, as well as identification of etiological mutations. Functional studies indicate, firstly, that the susceptible and protective HLA class II molecules HLA-DR and -DQ bind and present nonoverlapping peptides and, secondly, that the variable number of tandem repeats at the 5′ end of the insulin gene (susceptibility interval IDDM2) regulates insulin expression in the thymus.},

Because it contains many genes related to inflammatory and immune responses, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), lymphotoxin-$\alpha$ (LT-$\alpha$), and allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF-1) genes, it is unclear which gene within the class III region is responsible for the susceptibility to the disease. We sequenced the AIF-1 gene region and detected three novel polymorphisms, all of which were diallelic and localized at introns. Then, we investigated AIF-1, TNF, and LT-$\alpha$ gene polymorphisms in 165 patients with type 1 diabetes, consisting of 90 patients with young-onset type 1 diabetes, 75 patients with adult-onset type 1 diabetes, and 200 control patients. We also analyzed TNF receptors type 1 (TNFR1) and type 2 (TNFR2) gene polymorphisms, located on chromosome 12p13 and 1p36, respectively. Although there were significant differences between type 1 diabetes patients and controls in the distributions of TNF promoter polymorphisms at position −1031 and −857, and LT-$\alpha$ gene NcoI polymorphism, none of them was independently associated with the disease after two-locus analysis with HLA class II alleles. We detected the significantly increased frequency of the −383C allele, located in the TNFR-1 promoter region, in both young-onset and adult-onset diabetes patients compared with controls. In addition, the −383C allele was found to be associated with higher expression of the TNFR1 gene than that of −383A allele in in vitro expression. These results suggest that the TNFR1 gene region might be a susceptible locus to type 1 diabetes in Japanese.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Eukaryotic proteins are highly modular, containing multiple interaction interfaces that mediate binding to a network of regulators and effectors. Recent advances in high-throughput proteomics have rapidly expanded the number of known protein-protein interactions (PPIs), however, the molecular basis for the majority of these interactions remains to be elucidated. There has been a growing appreciation of the importance of a subset of these PPIs, namely those mediated by short linear motifs (SLiMs), particularly the canonical and ubiquitous SH2, SH3 and PDZ domain-binding motifs. However, these motif classes represent only a small fraction of known SLiMs and outside these examples little effort has been made, either bioinformatically or experimentally, to discover the full complement of motif instances. RESULTS: In this paper, interaction data is analysed to identify and characterise an important subset of PPIs, those involving short linear motifs (SLiMs) binding to globular domains. To do this, we introduce iELM, a method to identify interactions mediated by SLiMs and add molecular details of the interaction interfaces to both interacting proteins. The method identifies SLiM-mediated interfaces from protein-protein interaction data by searching for known SLiM-domain pairs. This approach was applied to the human interactome to identify a set of high-confidence putative SLiM-mediated protein-protein interactions.

abstract = {Pancreatectomy (90%) at a preinsulitis age (7 weeks) protects NOD mice from diabetes while pancreatectomy at a mid-insulitis age (13 weeks) has no such protective effect. The present study examined the effects of islet transplantation in pancreatectomized diabetes-free NOD mice. Transplantation of syngeneic NOD islets as well as allogeneic C3H/He and C57BL/6 islets 3 weeks after pancreatectomy-induced spontaneous diabetes whereas transplantation of xenogeneic Sprague--Dawley rat islets or allogeneic C3H/He skin failed to induce diabetes, demonstrating that the diabetogenic antigen(s) of NOD islets is also expressed by islets of diabetes-resistant mouse strains but not by xenogeneic rat islets. Removal of NOD islet grafts by nephrectomy 7--14 days after transplantation had no effect on the subsequent chronic development of diabetes, while graft removal 3 days after transplantation completely abolished the diabetogenic effect of islet transplantation. Thus, activation of the diabetogenic response by islet isografting takes less than 7 days and the continuous presence of a large islet mass is not required for progression to diabetes. While islet transplantation at 10 and 15 weeks of age caused diabetes, delayed islet transplantation at 23 and 35 weeks of age failed to induce diabetes in pancreatectomized diabetes-free NOD mice, suggesting that initiation of the diabetogenic autoimmune process must take place within a certain window of time. The pancreatectomy/islet transplantation model is excellent for studying the immunological events surrounding activation and progression of the diabetogenic autoimmune process and for identifying the diabetogenic islet antigen(s).},

Using CD40-positive diabetogenic T cell clones and CD4 T cells from NOD mice, we examined expression of CD40 upon activation through the TCR and costimulation through either CD28 or CD40. Our results indicate that CD40 expression is increased upon activation with antigen/MHC and that activation of NOD CD4 T cells through TCR/CD40 rapidly induced CD40 expression. Furthermore, CD40 costimulation promoted T cell proliferation to the same extent as costimulation through TCR/CD28. Importantly, costimulation of CD4 T cells through CD40 also interfered with T cell homeostasis by altering regulation of CTLA-4 expression. Through CD40--CD154 blocking studies, we demonstrated that signaling between T cells through CD40 and its ligand contributes to activation of pathogenic T cells and that blocking CD40 on T cells abrogates their ability to transfer diabetes. Thus, costimulation through CD40 on NOD T cells contributes to their pathogenicity by providing additional pathways for activation and by inhibiting upregulation of CTLA-4 during T cell activation.},

During normal perinatal development, macrophages (M$\Phi$) are involved in phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons. Pertinently, M$\Phi$ are already present at birth in NOD pancreata. Their possible abnormal control of nerve phagocytosis, together with transient $\beta$-cell hyperactivity and lymphocyte anomalies, might conjointly participate in T1D pathogenesis.},

Accumulating evidence strongly supports viral infection as an important factor in the etiology of T1D. To this effect, several viruses have been associated with the capacity to induce or exacerbate T1D in both humans and mice. The most convincing evidence linking viral infection and autoimmunity comes from studies on enteroviruses, particularly coxsackievirus. In this review we will discuss the evidence associating coxsackievirus infection to T1D and present the current state of knowledge on the potential mechanism of coxsackievirus-mediated T1D.},

abstract = {In the last decade, advances in high-throughput technologies such as DNA microarrays have made it possible to simultaneously measure the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes and proteins. This has resulted in large amounts of biological data requiring analysis and interpretation. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was introduced as an unsupervised, parts-based learning paradigm involving the decomposition of a nonnegative matrix V into two nonnegative matrices, W and H, via a multiplicative updates algorithm. In the context of a pxn gene expression matrix V consisting of observations on p genes from n samples, each column of W defines a metagene, and each column of H represents the metagene expression pattern of the corresponding sample. NMF has been primarily applied in an unsupervised setting in image and natural language processing. More recently, it has been successfully utilized in a variety of applications in computational biology. Examples include molecular pattern discovery, class comparison and prediction, cross-platform and cross-species analysis, functional characterization of genes and biomedical informatics. In this paper, we review this method as a data analytical and interpretive tool in computational biology with an emphasis on these applications.},

abstract = {We have recently reported that chronic and systemic administration of tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF) inhibits development of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice and BB rats, animal models of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). During these experiments, we unexpectedly found that in vivo production of TNF stimulated by a single injection of lipopolysaccharide was enhanced approximately 10 times in the long-term diabetic BB rats (P {\&}lt; 0.0001), whose mean duration of diabetes with more than 16.8 mM (300 mg/dl) of nonfasting blood glucose level was 26.2 $\pm$ 2.1 days, as compared to that in the rats of nondiabetes and in the rats at the onset of diabetes, whose mean duration of diabetes was 1.4 $\pm$ 0.6 days. The long-term diabetic, but not short-term-diabetic, rats were also associated with increased levels of serum fructosamine/albumin (P {\&}lt; 0.01) and triglyceride (P {\&}lt; 0.01) and with a decreased level of serum albumin (P {\&}lt; 0.01). The in vivo TNF productivity in the diabetic rats, including the short-term- and long-term-diabetic rats, was correlated positively with the level of fructosamine/albumin (P {\&}lt; 0.05) and negatively with the level of serum albumin (P {\&}lt; 0.05), but not with levels of blood glucose. None of these correlations were observed in nondiabetic rats. The increased LPS-induced serum TNF activity in the long-term diabetic state was observed not only in BB rats but also in NOD mice and GK rats, a model of non-IDDM, irrespective of sexes and ages, indicating that the enhancement of in vivo TNF production was a result of long-term diabetes. These findings indicate that some factor(s) associated with the long-term-diabetic state may prime macrophages in vivo to produce TNF. Further study is needed to reveal a mechanism of the enhanced TNF production and its possible relevance to various abnormalities associated with the chronic hyperglycemic state.},

Recently we have further reported that lymphotoxin (LT), a cytokine with functional and structural characteristics similar to those of TNF, also protected NOD mice from diabetes. In this study, we have extended our observation on the LT to BB rats. Male and female BB/Wor rats were treated intraperitoneally with recombinant human LT three times a week from 4 to 11 weeks of age. The cumulative incidence of diabetes by 14 weeks of age was 24/30 (80.0%) in nontreated control rats, whereas it was 10/26 (38.5% vs control, P {\&}lt; 0.01) and 4/29 (13.8% vs control, P {\&}lt; 0.0001) in the rats treated with 1 × 103 and 1 × 101 of LT, respectively. There was no significant difference in nonfasting blood glucose levels and body weights between nontreated control and LT-treated rats, which were nondiabetic. In the LT-treated rats, intensity of insulitis was significantly reduced in comparison with the nontreated rats. Concanavalin A-stimulated TNF/LT productivity of spleen cells was significantly lower in BB/Wor and BB/Sendai rats than in Wistar rats or other normal rat strains. On the other hand, there was no difference between BB/Sendai and Wistar rats in the in vivo TNF/ LT productivity induced with LPS or with IFN-$\gamma$ plus LPS, and the TNF/LT productivity of these rats was lower on stimulation with LPS alone, but higher with IFN-$\gamma$ plus LPS than the other normal rats. These results indicate that treatment with LT, as well as TNF, modulated autoimmunity and prevented development of IDDM in BB/Wor rats which may be low producers of TNF/LT.},

We assessed the global effects of gene overexpression or gene deletion to map an integrated genetic interaction network of synthetic dosage lethal (SDL) and loss-of-function genetic interactions (GIs) for 92 kinases, producing a meta-network of 8700 GIs enriched for pathways known to be regulated by cognate kinases. Kinases most sensitive to dosage perturbations had constitutive cell cycle or cell polarity functions under standard growth conditions. Condition-specific screens confirmed that the spectrum of kinase dosage interactions can be expanded substantially in activating conditions. An integrated network composed of systematic SDL, negative and positive loss-of-function GIs, and literature-curated kinase-substrate interactions revealed kinase-dependent regulatory motifs predictive of novel gene-specific phenotypes. Our study provides a valuable resource to unravel novel functional relationships and pathways regulated by kinases and outlines a general strategy for deciphering mutant phenotypes from large-scale GI networks.},

In one of the induced models of autoimmunity, experimental allergic encephalomyelities (EAE), a very small heterogeneity of T-cell receptor (TcR) molecules is expressed by the pathogenic T cells in both rats and mice. Contrary to induced autoimmune diseases, little is known about the autoantigens recognized by these autoimmune T cells and the heterogeneity of their TcR in spontaneous autoimmune diseases. The aim of this work was to establish a system which allows characterization of relevant autoantigens in spontaneous insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. A completely different approach was taken to characterize the gene products of the minor lymphocyte stimulatory (Mls) loci. These gene products are responsible for the clonal elimination or the clonal stimulation of T cells expressing particular TcR V$\beta$ genes and therefore could be implicated in induction of autoimmune diseases by oligoclonal T-cell populations. The finding that Mls antigens are encoded by retroviral sequences leads to the hypothesis that viruses could be the inducing agents of autoimnune diseases.},

abstract = {Summary This review provides basic information concerning the major animal models in use for the study of autoimmune endocrine diseases (AEDs). Although several other models exist which parallel human AEDs such as autoimmune orchitis, most research in this area has centred on animal models of insulindependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and thyroiditis. These models, between them, appear to exhibit most of the disease manifestations of their human counterparts and thereby permit the study of possible methods of intervention in the disease process. While no one model represents a perfect correlation with the human disease it represents, common characteristics are recognizable between them. For instance, the central role of activated T cells in controlling the disease process. The chapter continues by examining the various ways in which models of autoimmunity, specifically IDDM and experimental allergic thyroiditis (EAT), have been used to investigate the possibility of preventing or arresting autoimmune destruction. Several different approaches are described that illustrate the variety of techniques that have proven both potentially, or in reality, effective and those that have proven less efficacious than first hoped.},

We investigated 11 TNF/LTA tag polymorphisms, designed to capture the majority of common variation in the region, in 160 trio families from South Croatia. We observed overtransmission of alleles from parents to affected child at five variants: (rs909253, allele C, p = 1.2×10−4; rs1041981, allele A, p = 1.1×10−4; rs1800629 (G-308A), allele A, p = 1.2×10−4; rs361525 (G-238A), allele G, p = 8.2×10−3 and rs3093668, allele G, p = 0.014). We also identified overtransmission of the rs1800629(G-308A)-rs361525(G-238A) A-G haplotype, p = 2.384×10−5. The present study found an association of the TNF/LTA gene region with type 1 diabetes. A careful assessment of TNF/LTA variants adjusted for linkage disequilibrium with HLA loci is needed to further clarify the role of these genes in type 1 diabetes susceptibility in the population of South Croatia.},

After only 3 to 5 weeks of diabetes, NOD mice developed markedly swollen axons and dendrites (``neuritic dystrophy'') in the prevertebral superior mesenteric and celiac ganglia (SMG-CG), similar to the pathology described in diabetic STZ- and BBW-rat and man. Comparable changes failed to develop in the superior cervical ganglia of the NOD mouse or in the SMG-CG of non-diabetic NOD siblings. STZ-induced diabetic mice develop identical changes, although at a much slower pace and to a lesser degree than NOD mice. NOD-SCID mice, which are genetically identical to NOD mice except for the absence of T and B cells, do not develop diabetes or neuropathology comparable to diabetic NOD mice. However, STZ-treated NOD-SCID mice develop severe neuritic dystrophy, evidence against an exclusively autoimmune pathogenesis for autonomic neuropathy in this model. Chronically diabetic type 2 db/db mice fail to develop neuritic dystrophy, suggesting that hyperglycemia alone may not be the critical and sufficient element. The NOD mouse appears to be a valuable model of diabetic sympathetic autonomic neuropathy with unambiguous, rapidly developing neuropathology which corresponds closely to the characteristic pathology of other rodent models and man.},

We have been interested in whether the HSP65 serves as an immunogenic carrier for a diabetogenic peptide P277 can also induce anti-inflammatory immune response in NOD mice by mucosal administration. Thus, the dual functions of anti-type 1 diabetes of HSP65 and P277 will be obtained. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of intranasal vaccination with P277 tandem repeat sequences carried by HSP65 in the absence of adjuvants on autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. We found a significant decrease in the incidence of diabetes, inhibition of insulitis, reduction in IgG2a isotype antibodies to P277 and proinflammatory cytokines IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-2 secretion, increased IgG1, IgG2b subclass antibodies to P277 and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-4 secretion, and reduced proliferation in nasal administration of the fusion protein HSP65-6{\&}{\#}xa0;×{\&}{\#}xa0;P277. Our results demonstrate that HSP65 may serve as a particularly advantageous carrier for P277-based vaccines and mucosal administration may be a therapeutic approach for treatment of type 1 diabetes.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease resulting from the selective autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet $\beta$ cells. The absence and/or breakdown of immune self-tolerance to islet $\beta$ cells is now recognized as the essential cause for the development of the diabetogenic autoimmune response. For a long time, a failure in peripheral tolerogenic mechanisms was regarded as the main source of an inappropriate immune process directed against insulin-secreting $\beta$ cells. While defective peripheral self-tolerance still deserves to be further investigated, the demonstration that all members of the insulin gene family are transcribed in thymic epithelial cells (TECs) of different species under the control of the AutoImmune REgulator (AIRE) gene/protein has highlighted the importance of central self-tolerance to insulin-secreting islet $\beta$ cells. Moreover, there is now evidence that a primary or acquired failure in thymus-dependent central self-tolerance to $\beta$ cells plays a primary role in T1D pathogenesis. This novel knowledge is currently translated into the development of innovative tolerogenic/regulatory approaches designed to reprogram the specific immune self-tolerance to islet $\beta$ cells.},

abstract = {Diabetes can be associated with cerebral dysfunction in humans and animal models of the disease. Moreover, brain anomalies and alterations of the neuroendocrine system are present in type 1 diabetes (T1D) animals, such as the spontaneous nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model and/or the pharmacological streptozotocin (STZ)-induced model. Because of the prevalent role of astrocytes in cerebral glucose metabolism and their intimate connection with neurones, we investigated hippocampal astrocyte alterations in prediabetic and diabetic NOD mice and STZ-treated diabetic mice. The number and cell area related to the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive astrocytes were quantified in the stratum radiatum region of the hippocampus by computerized image analysis in prediabetic (2, 4 and 8 weeks of age) and diabetic (16-week-old) NOD female mice, age and sex-matched lymphocyte-deficient NODscid and C57BL/6 control mice and, finally, STZ-induced diabetic and vehicle-treated nondiabetic 16-week-old C57BL/6 female mice. Astrocyte number was higher early in life in prediabetic NOD and NODscid mice than in controls, when transient hyperinsulinemia and low glycemia were found in these strains. The number and cell area of GFAP+ cells further increased after the onset of diabetes in NOD mice. Similarly, in STZ-treated diabetic mice, the number of GFAP+ cells and cell area were higher than in vehicle-treated mice. In conclusion, astrocyte changes present in genetic and pharmacological models of T1D appear to reflect an adaptive process to alterations of glucose homeostasis.},

Mice immunized with GAD65, showed splinic T-cell reactivity to GAD 65in vitroassessed by cytokine secretion. However untreated NOD mice did not. NOD mice showed a vigorous IFN-$\gamma$ response after one immunization, whereas NMRI mice showed a lower response. IL-4 and IL-10 were only detected after two immunizations with higher levels in BALB/c, NMRI and NOD mice, compared to C57B1/6 mice. High levels of GAD65 antibodies were detected in all mice immunized with GAD65, though lower levels were found in C57B1/6 mice. Histological analysis of pancreata revealed that no control mice, regardless of treatment, had mononuclear cell infiltration in the islets. In NOD mice, peri-insulitis was detected in all groups, but less so in GAD65 and bovine serum albumin (BSA) immunized animals. These data demonstrate that NOD mice respond more vigorously to immunization with GAD65 than non-diabetic mice strains. Furthermore, immunization with GAD65 is not sufficient to provoke onset of diabetes in NOD mice or induce islet cell pathology in non-diabetes prone mice.},

Patients (n = 133) with high-risk genotypes (DR3/DR3, DR3/DR4, DR4/DR4) were selected from the Lazio (Rome) region of Italy. Screening of more than 9000 patients from the Lazio region and northern Italy yielded 162 controls with high-T1D-risk haplotypes. Although the overall distributions did not differ significantly, allele frequency differences were discovered between the controls from Lazio and controls from northern Italy for some alleles previously determined to affect T1D risk, such as A*3002, DPB1*0301, and DPB1*0402. Therefore, Lazio patient data were compared both with the Lazio subset of controls (n = 53) and with the entire group of controls for association analyses. Significant allele frequency differences between patients and DR-DQ-matched controls existed for specific alleles at all loci. Data for the DR3/DR3 subset of patients and controls demonstrated an increase of Cw*0702 in patients. Compared with controls, reduced patient frequencies were seen for several alleles, including A*0101, B*0801, and Cw*0701, all on the highly conserved, extended DR3 haplotype known as 8.1 in DR3/DR3, but not DR3/DR4, subgroup. DPB1*0101, often reported on 8.1 haplotypes, was also less frequent in DR3/DR3 patients than controls. Analysis of family-based data from the HBDI repository was consistent with the observed results from the Italian patients, indicating the presence of a T1D-protective locus at or near A*0101 and a second T1D-protective locus at or near DPB1*0101. These data indicate that T1D risk conferred by the 8.1 haplotype is genotype dependent.},

This report describes a method that allows routine isolation of relatively large numbers of T cells highly enriched for reactivity toward islet antigens. The method involves renal subcapsular transplantation of spontaneously diabetic NOD mice with NOD islets. These grafts are rapidly destroyed in a tissue-specific manner and this destruction is accompanied by lymphocytic infiltration. Here we demonstrate that the islet graft infiltrates are an excellent source of islet-specific T cells and that islet-specific T-cell lines and clones can be established from these cells. Islet-specific T-cell clones isolated from a T-cell line established from the islet graft infiltrates were capable of adoptive transfer of diabetes to NOD/LtSz-scid recipients.},

abstract = {Modulation of $\beta$-cell antigens at birth may affect the course of type I diabetes. Since the functional state of $\beta$ cells modulates antigen expression, we investigated whether neonatal injections of glucose and arginine (G-A) influence diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Two groups of 90 mice (45 female, 45 male) were injected for the first 6 days of life with G-A or saline. To determine whether these injections influenced $\beta$ cell functional maturation, isolated islets were characterized according to insulin response to glucose or arginine. Modulation of antigens for islet-cell autoantibodies (ICA antigens) was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using ICA-positive human sera. Variations of pancreatic glutamic acid decarboxylase 67-kD (GAD 67) mRNA were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe, and densitometry of the autoradiographic bands. Female NOD mice treated with G-A displayed diabetes earlier and with a higher incidence (P {\&}lt; .01) than control mice, whereas the diabetes incidence was not statistically modified in G-A-treated male NOD mice. Insulitis was more severe (P {\&}lt; .03) in 2-month-old G-A-treated female NOD mice than in control mice, but was not statistically modified in male NOD mice. In both sexes, ICA antigens and GAD 67 mRNA were higher in G-A-treated mice than in control mice (P {\&}lt; .01). Islets isolated after neonatal G-A injections exhibited improved insulin sensitivity to both stimuli (P {\&}lt; .01). Splenocyte subsets analyzed by cytofluorometry, as well as splenocyte proliferations in the presence of concanavalin or rat insulinoma cells or during syngeneic mixed-lymphocyte reaction, were not modified after G-A treatment. We conclude that neonatal injections of G-A enhance diabetes in female NOD mice. Even though hypotheses as to the direct effects on the immune system or deleterious effects of glucose and arginine on the $\beta$ cells cannot be excluded, the mechanisms behind the clinical effect could be related to accelerated maturation of $\beta$ cells and overexpression of islet antigens during the completion of immune self-tolerance, or to amplification of the destructive process due to the existence of more targets for effector cells. The same treatment does not significantly affect diabetes in male NOD mice whose resistance to disease could not be overcome simply by peripheral modulation of $\beta$-cell antigens.},

The translational potential to the clinical applications of cord blood stem cells has increased enormously in recent years, mainly because of its advantages including no risk to the donor, no ethical issues, low risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and rapid availability. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by an autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet $\beta$ cells. Understanding the nature and function of cord blood stem cells is an exciting challenge that might set the stage for new approaches to the treatment of T1D. Here, we review progress in this field and draw conclusions for the development of future therapeutics in T1D. New insights are provided on a unique type of cord blood-derived multipotent stem cells (CB-SC), including the molecular mechanisms underlying immune modulation by CB-SC, protection of $\beta$-cell mass, and promotion of islet $\beta$-cell neogenesis.},

Many studies have shown that CS has immunoregulatory activity in many disease models, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We studied whether CS could suppress the onset of diabetes by altering T lymphocyte subsets in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. We found that the onset of type1 diabetes in NOD mice was associated with an imbalance of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and IL-17 producing Th17 cells. Oral administration of CS resulted in reduction in the overall incidence of diabetes, and this was due to an increase in the ratio of Treg cells to Th17 in the spleen and pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs). Taken together, these data imply that CS is able to modulate Treg to Th17 cell ratio in vivo, thus contributing to the inhibition of diabetes.},

An association between AIP and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1*0405/DQB1*0401 haplotype has been reported, but linkage disequilibrium has precluded the identification of predisposing HLA gene(s). We studied the role of single HLA genes in the development of AIP in transgenic mice. Methods CD4+ T-cell−negative I-A$\beta$ chain−/− (Ab0) mice develop AIP spontaneously, likely due to dysregulation of CD8+ T- cell responses. We generated Ab0 nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice transgenic for HLA-DR*0405, leading to rescue of CD4+ T cells; we compared their susceptibility to AIP with HLA-DQ8 or HLA-DR*0401 (single) transgenic, or HLA-DR*0405/DQ8 (double) transgenic mice. Results CD4+ T-cell−competent HLA-DR*0405 transgenic Ab0 NOD mice develop AIP with high prevalence after sublethal irradiation and adoptive transfer of CD90+ T cells, leading to complete pancreatic atrophy. HLA-DR*0405 transgenic mice can also develop unprovoked AIP, whereas HLA-DR*0401, HLA-DQ8, and HLA-DR*0405/DQ8 transgenic Ab0 NOD controls all remained normal, even after irradiation and adoptive transfer of CD90+ T cells. Pancreas histology in HLA-DR*0405 transgenic mice was characterized by destructive infiltration of the exocrine tissue with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and macrophages. Mice with complete pancreatic atrophy lost weight, developed fat stools, and had reduced levels of serum lipase activity. Conclusions Because HLA-DR*0405 expression fails to protect mice from AIP, the HLA-DRB1*0405 allele appears to be an important risk factor for AIP on the HLA-DRB1*0405/DQB1*0401 haplotype. This humanized mouse model should be useful for studying immunopathogenesis, diagnostic markers, and therapy of human AIP.},

abstract = {Summary Genes and mechanisms involved in autoimmune diseases, affecting approximately 5% of human population, remain still obscure but there is accumulating evidence that common genetic factors might predispose to multiple autoimmune disorders. STAT4, a transcription factor transmitting signals induced by several key cytokines, has recently been identified as a genetic risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and Sj{\"o}gren's disease (SD), thus indicating that multiple autoimmune diseases may share common biochemical pathways that lead to immune deregulation. Here we demonstrate for the first time, in a genetically homogeneous population, the association of the STAT4 rs7574865 G/T polymorphism, which has been shown to be associated with these autoimmune diseases, with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D). The susceptibility is associated with a significant increase of the frequency of the T allele (p = 0.0012, two-tailed $\chi$2, OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.29--2.91) in this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). We also present an indication for association with Wegener's granulomatosis. These findings suggest that this variant form of STAT4 may have a putative key role in the development of a variety of autoimmune diseases, probably because of signaling defects that it causes in the IL-12 pathway.},

Igf2bp2 gene expression in kidney tissues of db/db and control mice at the ages of 5 and 26{\&}{\#}xa0;weeks was examined with real time RT-PCR and Western blot. Results An association of IGF2BP2 rs4402960 with T2D in the Czech population was replicated. This IGF2BP2 polymorphism (P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.037, OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.69 95% CI 0.49--0.98) was found to be associated with DN in male not in female patients with T1D selected from the GoKinD study. In the analyses of combined the GoKinD, Czech and Swedish populations, the association between IGF2BP2 polymorphism and DN in male patients with T1D was still significant (P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.030, OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.73, 95% CI 0.54--0.97). IGF2 rs10770125 was also associated with DN in male T1D patients of the GoKinD population (P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.038, OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.67 95% CI 0.46--0.98). There might be a genetic interaction between IGF2BP2 and IGF2 (P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.05). The Igf2bp2 gene expression levels were increased in the kidneys of db/db mice compared to controls at the age of 5{\&}{\#}xa0;weeks but not at 26{\&}{\#}xa0;weeks. Conclusions The present study has replicated the association of IGF2BP2 rs4402960 with T2D in the Czech population and provided data suggesting that IGF2BP2 may have genetic interaction with IGF2 with a protective effect against DN in male patients with T1D.},

abstract = {In this study, we compared the rate of insulin requirement among adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in 24 Ukrainian regions. The glutamic acid decaroxylase 65 antibody (GADA), insulin antibody (IA), and plasma c-peptide levels were investigated. The data included the prevalent cases of T1D in Ukraine at the end of 2006. Only persons aged over 14 years at the time of inclusion into the Ukrainian register and diagnosed with diabetes before 30 years of age were included in this study (n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;26{\&}{\#}xa0;796). A total of 86 T1D patients (42 males; 44 females) with a mean age of 27.5 years (0.86) and a mean diabetes duration of 10.3 (0.72) years (SE), were randomly selected from four regional diabetes registers. The GADA, IA, and the plasma c-peptide levels were also determined. The logistic regression model was used, and the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Furthermore, the differences in the T1D prevalence among the 24 Ukrainian regions were obtained (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.001). In the ``minimal'' regional cluster (MIC), the prevalence rate was 6 (5--6), and in the ``maximal'' (MAC) regional cluster, it was −{\&}{\#}xa0;9 (8--9) per 10{\&}{\#}xa0;000 adults. For patients with a disease duration (DD) of up to 15 years (n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;13{\&}{\#}xa0;677), the daily insulin dose (DID) was observed to increase linearly with DD (R{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.899, p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.001). The median insulin doses were standardized according to DD, and the values were lowest in the MIC and highest in the MAC populations: 45.89 (45.28--47.19) and 56.59 (53.33--57.88) U/24 h, respectively (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.01). Furthermore, the level of HbA1c in the MAC of T1D patients was observed to be higher than that in the MIC (9.52{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;2.24%, n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;240, and 8.57{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;3.29%, n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;111, respectively; p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.01). In addition, the GADA levels and persistence in the MAC patients (n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;38) were higher than that in the MIC patients (n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;48): 14.1{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;4.6 and 3.2{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;1.2 U/ml, respectively, mean{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;SE; p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.028; OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;9.66 (3.31--28.17), p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.001. Adjusting for age, gender, and duration of diabetes affected the results only slightly. Furthermore, the IA and c-peptide levels and their persistence were not observed to be associated with TD1 prevalence.},

abstract = {Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is diagnosed by clinical and histologic criteria that are often nonspecific and typically apparent only after the disease is well established. Because GvHD is mediated by donor T cells and other immune effector cells, we sought to determine whether changes within a wide array of peripheral blood lymphocyte populations could predict the development of GvHD. Peripheral blood samples from 31 patients undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplant were analyzed for the proportion of 121 different subpopulations defined by 4-color combinations of lymphocyte phenotypic and activation markers at progressive time points posttransplant. Samples were processed using a newly developed high content flow cytometry technique and subjected to a spline- and functional linear discriminant analysis (FLDA)-based temporal analysis technique. This strategy identified a consistent posttransplant increase in the proportion and extent of fluctuation of CD3+CD4+CD8beta+ cells in patients who developed GVHD compared to those that did not. Although larger prospective clinical studies will be necessary to validate these results, this study demonstrates that high-content flow cytometry coupled with temporal analysis is a powerful approach for developing new diagnostic tools, and may be useful for developing a sensitive and specific predictive test for GVHD.},

abstract = {Type 1A (immune-mediated) and type 2 diabetes mellitus are two of the most common severe chronic illnesses, affecting over 230 million people worldwide with an estimated global prevalence of 5.1%. Although type 1 and type 2 diabetes differ greatly in modes of pathogenesis, these illnesses share a common pathology and consequences characterized by loss of functional beta-cell mass and subsequent dysregulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Since therapy for diabetes and the associated complications poses enormous public health and economic burdens, novel preventive and regenerative therapies have emerged in the past decade with the aim to preserve beta-cell mass and delay the onset of diabetes. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of current efforts in the fight against diabetes, and attempts to document all strategies that have emerged in clinical studies within the past 25 years. First, strategies to identify individuals at risk, ranging from whole-genome scans to autoantibody screening, will be discussed. Second, novel approaches to prevent or delay the onset of disease will be covered. Particular focus is given on emerging strategies for individuals at risk for type 1 diabetes that target T-cell regulation and induction of tolerance, while new pharmaceutical concepts in combination with lifestyle interventions are discussed within the scope of type 2 diabetes prevention. Lastly, important efforts to halt disease progression with emphasis on beta-cell regeneration are presented.},

Lymphoid cell populations from non-immunized, non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice were investigated for spontaneous T-cell reactivity in vitro to rat insulin (identical to mouse insulin) and to porcine insulin (identical to mouse insulin in the immunogenic part of the A chain loop). No significant T-cell proliferation was detected. In vivo priming of non-diabetic NOD mice with rat insulin in CFA, or of diabetic or non-diabetic NOD mice with porcine insulin failed to elicit insulin-specific T-cell responses upon restimulation in vitro. Lymph node cells from NOD mice primed with porcine insulin and treated with anti-Lyt 2 antibodies and C′ also failed to show insulin-specific reactivity, indicating that suppression by Lyt 2 cells is not involved in the non-responsiveness observed. In addition to porcine and rat insulin, NOD mice were also non-responders to bovine insulin; however, they responded to equine and ovine insulin and to the oxidized chain B of bovine insulin, the latter showing no cross-stimulation in vitro to any of the intact insulin variants. In conclusion, this study indicates that autologous insulin does not serve as autoantigen in the autoimmune destruction of beta cells.},

Indeed, the role of TRPV1 in mediating pain during pancreatitis is well established. The initial excitation of these nerves by capsaicin is followed by a reversible refractory state (desensitization) or, under certain conditions such as neonatal treatment, neurotoxicity. Interestingly, ablation of TRPV1-positive fibers by subcutaneous capsaicin treatment not only ameliorates pancreatitis pain but also diminishes aging-associated weight gain and improves glucose tolerance both in mice on a high-fat diet and in rat models of type 2 diabetes. New evidence implies an unexpected, pivotal role for TRPV1 in type 1 (autoimmune) diabetes. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice carry a hypofunctional TRPV1 mutant. Ablation of nerves carrying this mutant TRPV1 by capsaicin prevents immune-mediated destruction of islet $\beta$ cells despite the persistence of diabetogenic T cells. Collectively, these findings establish a crucial link among sensory nerves, obesity and diabetes and identify pharmacological TRPV1 blockade as a novel therapeutic approach for diabetes prevention and weight control.},

Patients (238: 130 male, 108 female) and unaffected adult control individuals (137: 68 males and 69 females) have been genotyped for three variants in the SPP1 gene: −{\&}{\#}xa0;156 (G/GG) and −{\&}{\#}xa0;66 (T/G) in the promoter and a biallelic ins/del variant (TG/TGTG) at +{\&}{\#}xa0;245 in the first intron. The G allele at the −{\&}{\#}xa0;66 SNP had significantly higher frequency in controls than T1D patients. Interestingly, case-control comparison in males showed no significant association, whereas the association was confirmed in females. These results suggest that SPP1 can play a role as susceptibility gene, possibly by a sex-specific mechanism acting in the autoimmune process.},

There is a strong support for shared genetic determinants between various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In particular, linkage of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases has been reported on chromosome 16, encompassing the region containing the CARD15 gene. We therefore considered this gene as a good candidate for the T1D locus mapped to this region, and we tested the three CARD15 variants in the susceptibility to T1D in two independent settings: family based association analysis in Scandinavian multiplex families that we previously showed to be linked to this region, and case/control association study in a large cohort of French diabetic patients. We found no evidence for association of these variants with T1D overall, nor in subgroups of patients with or without the major risk genotypes at HLA-DRB1, at insulin (INS), or positive or negative for autoantibodies specific to other autoimmune diseases. Our results do not support a role for CD-associated CARD15 variants in the susceptibility to T1D, and suggest that another gene is responsible for the shared susceptibility between autoimmune and inflammatory diseases mapping to this region.},

abstract = {The impact of exposure to lead on gut cytokine gene expression and oral tolerance was analyzed. Oral tolerization with ovalbumin (OVA) increased levels of IL-10 and TGF-$\beta$ in gut tissue while IFN-$\gamma$ mRNA levels remained unchanged in both autoimmune diabetes prone NOD and normal C57BL/6 mice. This shift towards Th2/Th3 type cytokine gene expression was completely abolished by concomitant treatment with PbCl2 (6 × 0.5 mg/kg) in NOD mice while the cytokine balance in C57BL/6 mice was unaffected. Suppression of Th2/Th3 type cytokine expression was associated with a dampened oral tolerance response to OVA as determined by T cell proliferation assays. We conclude that in autoimmunity prone NOD mice environmental toxicants may disturb immune homeostasis by targeting the gut immune system.},

abstract = {The endocrine cells in the duodenum of pre-diabetic and diabetic female non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice aged 22--24 weeks were studied by means of immunohistochemistry and computed image analysis as well as by radioimmunoassays of tissue extracts. As controls, 12 female BALB/cJ mice of the same age as NOD mice were used. The number of secretin-immunoreactive cells increased in diabetic but not in pre-diabetic NOD mice. The level of extractable secretin was higher in both pre-diabetic and diabetic NOD mice. The number of GIP-, CCK/gastrin-, and serotonin-immunoreactive cells was significantly reduced in both pre-diabetic and diabetic NOD mice. There was no statistical difference in the number of somatostatin-immunoreactive cells between the NOD mice and controls. The level of GIP was higher and gastrin was lower in NOD mice compared to controls. There was no statistical difference in the somatostatin level between the NOD mice and controls. The cell secretory index was elevated in all the endocrine cell types except CCK/gastrin cells. It has been suggested that some of the changes in the duodenal endocrine cells could be attributed to the diabetes state, but most of the changes seem to take place before the onset of diabetes. The abnormalities in the duodenal endocrine cells observed here in an animal model for diabetes type I might have relevance for the gastrointestinal dysfunction displayed in human diabetes.},

abstract = {After decades of mouse and human research, we now know that natural killer (NK) cells have unique properties including memory. Although initially described as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) unrestricted killers, NK cells have several families of receptors that directly recognize MHC including Ly49 receptors in the mouse and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) in humans. The strength of this signal is determined by polymorphisms in NK cell inhibitory receptor genes and their MHC ligands inherited on different chromosomes. Inhibitory receptors protect ``self''-expressing normal tissue from being killed by NK cells and protecting against autoimmunity. Therefore, for NK cells to kill and produce cytokines, they must encounter activating receptor ligands in the context of ``missing self'' that occurs with some viral infections and malignant transformation. The second property of inhibitory receptors is to educate or license NK cells to acquire function. This is best demonstrated in the mouse and in humans by enhanced function on self-inhibitory receptor-expressing NK cells when in a host expressing cognate ligate. In contrast, NK cells without inhibitory receptors or with nonself-inhibitory receptors are relatively hyporesponsive. The basic biology of NK cells in response to cytokines, education, and viruses will translate into strategies to manipulate NK cells for therapeutic purposes.},

The mechanism of IDDM risk modification by HLA polymorphism is likely to involve differential presentation of autoantigenic peptides by HLA class II proteins. We have generated T cell lines (TCL) with specificity for the IDDM autoantigen 65{\&}{\#}xa0;kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) from lymphocytes of two patients carrying HLA class II alleles associated with distinct risk of IDDM (DRB1*0101/0401 and 1302/1501). For both patients, TCL generated at various time points all recognized single epitopes mapped as GAD 88--99 and 248--257, respectively. These epitopes are presented by the DRB1*0101 and DRB5*0101, HLA class II molecules associated with a moderately elevated risk of IDDM, or carried in a strongly protective haplotype, respectively. In an HLA/peptide binding assay, epitope GAD 248--257 was shown to possess high affinity for DRB5*0101. This epitope overlaps with a central GAD peptide binding to the high risk allele DQB1*0302 and containing a Coxsackie P2C-identical mimicry sequence, raising the possibility of competition of DRB5*0101 and DQB1*0302 for binding of a central GAD65 fragment.},

abstract = {Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone/cytokine that links nutritional status with neuroendocrine and immune functions. In humans, leptin influences energy homeostasis and regulates neuroendocrine function primarily in states of energy deficiency. Initially described as an antiobesity hormone, leptin has subsequently been shown also to influence basal metabolism, hematopoiesis, thermogenesis, reproduction, and angiogenesis. As a cytokine, leptin can affect thymic homeostasis and the secretion of acute-phase reactants such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$). Leptin links nutritional status and proinflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) immune responses and the decrease in leptin plasma concentration during food deprivation leads to impaired immune function. Similar to other pro-inflammatory cytokines, leptin promotes Th1-cell differentiation and can modulate the onset and progression of autoimmune responses in several animal models of disease. Here, we review the advances and controversy for a role of leptin in the pathophysiology of immune responses and discuss novel possible therapeutic implications for leptin modulators.},

Mice injected with anti-CD3 mAb neonatally were protected from T1D. However, all of these anti-CD3 mAb treated PDL1−/−.NOD mice developed a wasting disease between 12 and 20{\&}{\#}xa0;weeks of age with sudden deterioration and weight loss, leading to death within 3--5{\&}{\#}xa0;days of development of illness.

In addition, most T1D patients would do almost anything to achieve release from the burden of daily glucose monitoring and insulin injection. Despite the formation of very large and promising clinical trials, a means to prevent/cure T1D in humans remains elusive. This has led to an increasing interest in the possibility of using T cells with regulatory properties (Treg cells) as a biological therapy to preserve and restore tolerance to self-antigens. In the present review we will attempt to consolidate learning from the past and to describe what we now believe could in the future become a successful Treg-cell based immune intervention in T1D.},

Transfer of activated BDC T cells into NOD.scid mice resulted in diabetes within a week, characterized by strong inflammatory reaction. Electron micrographs of pancreas depicted macrophages in close contact with $\beta$ cells that exhibited signs of apoptosis. Transfer into irradiated recipients inhibited inflammation and the development of diabetes, demonstrating an obligatory role for leukocytes. Selective depletion of neutrophils or natural killer cells had no effect on diabetes induced by BDC2.5 T cells. In contrast, in vivo depletion of phagocytic cells by injection of liposomes containing clodronate abolished diabetes, although inflammation remained present and was characterized mainly by neutrophil infiltration. Treatment with clodronate-liposomes did not affect the antigen-presenting cells within the pancreas. Last, activated macrophages isolated from infiltrated pancreas exhibited cytolytic activity toward primary islet $\beta$ cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that activated macrophages are the key cells mediating islet $\beta$-cell death induced by activated CD4+ T cells.},

In Experiment 1, diabetic and normoglycemic mice exercised 5 h/day, 5 days/week for 3 weeks matched with non-exercising controls. In diabetic animals a positive correlation was found between blood glucose and the number of revolutions performed (P ≤ 0.02). Exercise also significantly lowered blood glucose between baseline and post-exercise in both diabetic and normoglycemic animals. In Experiment 2, mice exercised 2 h/day, 5 days/week. For the diabetic animals, glycosylated hemoglobin was lower than that of matched non-exercising diabetic animals at week 3 (11.1 $\pm$ 0.6% vs. 15.0 $\pm$ 1.6%, P {\&}lt; 0.001). Diabetic runners were able to train and significantly increased running in the first 4 weeks (P {\&}lt; 0.05). At the end of 9 weeks all 5 diabetic runners were alive, compared with 3 of 5 non-running diabetic animals. We conclude: (i) the NOD mouse is a useful model for the study of exercise in Type 1 diabetes, (ii) running exercise is associated with a drop in blood glucose, (iii) the amount of voluntary exercise performed correlates with blood glucose in diabetic animals, and (iv) diabetic mice will increase running distance in the first few weeks after diagnosis.},

Results Endothelial function, assessed noninvasively by peripheral arterial tonometry, was impaired in the T1D group in the fasting state as compared with control subjects (T1D 1.78 $\pm$ 0.4, control subjects 2.06 $\pm$ 0.4, P = .02), and worsened postprandially in both groups (T1D 1.45 $\pm$ 0.3, control subjects 1.71 $\pm$ 0.3, P = .01). Both groups demonstrated significantly elevated triglyceride levels 3.5 hours after ingestion of the high-fat meal (T1D 114.8 $\pm$ 42.8 and control subjects 126.7 $\pm$ 54.9 mg/dL). Nutrient intake in both groups showed higher than recommended intakes of total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. Conclusions Patients with T1D exhibited worse endothelial function both before and after a high-fat breakfast than their peers. This suggests that patients with T1D are at greater risk of vascular impairment after a high-fat meal, the cumulative effect of which may contribute to the higher atherosclerotic burden observed in T1D.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that insulin is a primary autoantigen for type 1 diabetes. Several studies have identified preproinsulin (PPI) 76--90 as an immunodominant CD4+ T cell epitope. We developed a class II tetramer reagent using a modified PPI peptide with a lysine to serine substitution at position 88 (PPI 78--9088S) that has high binding affinity to DRA1*0101/DRB1*0401 (DR0401). Using this tetramer, positive responses were observed from both DR0401 healthy and type 1 diabetic subjects when T cells were stimulated with the PPI 78--9088S peptide. Seventy percent of these T cells proliferated in response to both the wild type PPI 76--90 and PPI 78--9088S peptides. However, when T cells were stimulated with wild type peptide and assayed with DR0401/PPI 78--9088S, positive responses were only detected in the diabetic group but not in healthy subjects. When highly purified CD4+CD25−CD45RA+ T cells were stimulated with PPI 78--9088S peptide in the absence of antigen-presenting cells, T cells from the diabetic group were able to respond to peptide stimulation, while T cells from healthy subjects were not. These data suggest that T cells from type 1 diabetic subjects have a lower threshold of activation in response to PPI peptide stimulation as compared to healthy subjects.},

abstract = {Autoimmune diabetes is caused by selective loss of insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells. The main factors directly implicated in beta-cell death are autoreactive, cytotoxic (islet-antigen specific) T-lymphocytes (CTL), and inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we have used an antigen-specific model of virally induced autoimmune diabetes to demonstrate that even high numbers of autoreactive CTL are unable to lyse beta-cells by perforin unless major histocompatibility complex class I is upregulated on islets. This requires the presence of inflammatory cytokines induced by viral infection of the exocrine pancreas but not of the beta-cells. Unexpectedly, we found that the resulting perforin-mediated killing of beta-cells by autoreactive CTL is not sufficient to lead to clinically overt diabetes in vivo, and it is not an absolute prerequisite for the development of insulitis, as shown by studies in perforin-deficient transgenic mice. In turn, destruction of beta-cells also requires a direct effect of gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), which is likely to be in synergy with other cytokines, as shown in double transgenic mice that express a mutated IFN-gamma receptor on their beta-cells in addition to the viral (target) antigen and do not develop diabetes. Thus, destruction of most beta-cells occurs as cytokine-mediated death and requires IFN-gama in addition to perforin. Understanding these kinetics could be of high conceptual importance for the design of suitable interventions in prediabetic individuals at risk to develop type 1 diabetes.},

abstract = {Genes and mechanisms involved in common complex diseases, such as the autoimmune disorders that affect approximately 5% of the population, remain obscure. Here we identify polymorphisms of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 gene (CTLA4)--which encodes a vital negative regulatory molecule of the immune system--as candidates for primary determinants of risk of the common autoimmune disorders Graves' disease, autoimmune hypothyroidism and type 1 diabetes. In humans, disease susceptibility was mapped to a non-coding 6.1 kb 3' region of CTLA4, the common allelic variation of which was correlated with lower messenger RNA levels of the soluble alternative splice form of CTLA4. In the mouse model of type 1 diabetes, susceptibility was also associated with variation in CTLA-4 gene splicing with reduced production of a splice form encoding a molecule lacking the CD80/CD86 ligand-binding domain. Genetic mapping of variants conferring a small disease risk can identify pathways in complex disorders, as exemplified by our discovery of inherited, quantitative alterations of CTLA4 contributing to autoimmune tissue destruction.},

These animal studies indicate that `vaccination' with insulin or its peptides looks very promising as a prevention method. Results of pilot trials in humans are also encouraging for the prospects of using insulin for primary prevention. Recent data from prospective studies in humans suggest that it will soon be possible to predict with reasonable certainty from genetic and autoantibody screening who is likely to develop type 1A diabetes.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput flow cytometry experiments produce hundreds of large multivariate samples of cellular characteristics. These samples require specialized processing to obtain clinically meaningful measurements. A major component of this processing is a form of cell subsetting known as gating. Manual gating is time-consuming and subjective. Good automatic and semi-automatic gating algorithms are very beneficial to high-throughput flow cytometry. RESULTS: We develop a statistical procedure, named curvHDR, for automatic and semi-automatic gating. The method combines the notions of significant high negative curvature regions and highest density regions and has the ability to adapt well to human-perceived gates. The underlying principles apply to dimension of arbitrary size, although we focus on dimensions up to three. Accompanying software, compatible with contemporary flow cytometry infor-matics, is developed. CONCLUSION: The method is seen to adapt well to nuances in the data and, to a reasonable extent, match human perception of useful gates. It offers big savings in human labour when processing high-throughput flow cytometry data whilst retaining a good degree of efficacy.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) develops as a consequence of a progressive autoimmune response that destroys insulin-producing $\beta$-cells in pancreatic islets. Because of their role(s) in controlling immune responses, considerable effort has been directed toward resolving whether regulatory T cells (Tregs) offer a clinical treatment to restore tolerance in T1D. We previously reported that in vitro-induced adaptive Treg cells (aTregs) can reverse T1D and persist as protective memory cells in the NOD mouse model. In the current study, we investigated mechanisms that regulate aTregs. We found that these FoxP3+ aTregs expressed high levels of the IL-7 receptor, IL-7R$\alpha$, without the high affinity receptor for IL-2, CD25, which is found on natural Treg cells (nTregs). IL-7R$\alpha$ expression was mirrored by the dependency of aTregs on IL-7 for persistence. IL-10 and TGF-$\beta$, effector cytokines of aTregs, were not essential for their maintenance at the level of systemic antibody blocking. Nevertheless, IL-10 modulated cytokine production by aTregs and TGF-$\beta$ was critical for protection. aTregs were found to infiltrate islets and the expression of integrin-$\beta$7 was required for their localization in the pancreas. Furthermore, blocking aTreg entry into the pancreas prevented their control of diabetogenic effector T cells, implying the need for local control of the autoimmune response. The distinct homeostatic regulation of aTregs independently of a response to IL-2, which is defective in T1D patients, suggests that these cells represent a translatable candidate to control the autoimmune response.},

The first external domain of the Class II MHC I-A$\beta$ chain in these mice is unique and has been suggested as being responsible for autoimmunity. The I-A$\alpha$ chain in these mice is I-A$\alpha$d, and they lack the expression of I-E molecules. We have investigated immune responses to various Ir gene control antigens in NOD mice to determine the influence of the NOD Ia and particularly the I-A$\beta$ chain. We find that sheep insulin is highly immunogenic while other insulins are weakly immunogenic in these mice. Hen egg lysozyme, pigeon cytochrome C and the synthetic polypeptide Poly 18, Poly EYK (EYA)5 antigen produce good antibody responses. Apart from H-2d, NOD are the only mice where Poly 18 antigen is immunogenic. In these mice Poly 18 induced good T-cell proliferative response, which was inhibited by anti-Ia antibody, and the mice were able to respond to tyrosine-containing polypeptide Poly EYA but not to the phenylalanine-containing antigen Poly EFA. We also found that synthetic peptide 48--60 of the NOD I-A$\beta$ chain is highly immunogenic in syngeneic NOD mice both for T cells and B cells. Using an I-A$\beta$ chain-specific monoclonal antibody, we are able to prevent induction of diabetes when the antibody was administrated in prediabetic, young mice. Our results suggest that the immune response to various antigens and autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice is directly influenced by the I-A$\beta$ chain.},

Two types of T cells are involved in diabetes: turncoat auto-reactive T cells, or T cells gone bad, that kill the insulin-producing cells, and regulatory T cells that are unable to control the auto-reactive T cells. We formulate a mathematical model that incorporates the role of cytotoxic T cells and regulatory T cells in type 1 diabetes. This study shows that onset of type 1 diabetes is due to a collective, dynamical instability, rather than being caused by a single etiological factor. It is also a numbers game between regulatory T cells and auto-reactive T cells. The problem in the onset of this disease is that there are not enough of the regulatory cells that suppress the immune response against the body's insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells.},

abstract = {T1D is an autoimmune disorder, which involves the CD4+ as well as CD8+ T-cell--mediated destruction of $\beta$ cells. Recently, another population of T cells (Th17) is found to be involved in T1D pathology. This review will discuss the characteristics of Th17 cells and the mechanism of Th17-mediated T1D development. Th17 cell expansion is unstrained under T1D condition. Certain Treg cells are defective in T1D and lose the control of Th17 expansion. In addition, the altered function of APCs and a subset of monocytes which spontaneously secrete IL-1$\beta$ and IL-6 in T1D determine the abnormal expansion of Th17 as well. The pathogenic Th17 cells can cause the imbalance between Teff and Treg cells. Conversion from Th17 to Th1 phenotype and Th17 stimulated CTL responses may play an accessory role in T1D as well. Due to the effects of Th17 on T1D, therapeutic strategies designed to inhibit these cells are applicable and the positive effects are obvious. Taken together, Th17 may exert essential effects on the development of T1D. Identification of the underlying mechanism may inspire new viewpoints for the therapy of this disease.},

abstract = {NOD (non-obese diabetic) mice develop type 1 diabetes mellitus spontaneously and with a strong similarity to the human disease. Differentiation and function of pancreas $\beta$ cells are regulated by a variety of hormones and growth factors, including the nerve growth factor (NGF). Gangliosides have multiple immunomodulatory activities with immunosuppressive properties, decreasing lymphoproliferative responses and modulating cytokine production. In the present study, serum, pancreas islets and spleen mononuclear cells from NOD mice treated with monosialic ganglioside GM1 (100{\&}{\#}xa0;mg/kg/day) and the group control which received saline solution were isolated to investigate the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1$\beta$, IFN-$\gamma$, IL-12, TNF-$\alpha$), NGF and its high-affinity receptor TrkA, peri-islet Schwann cells components (GFAP, S100-$\beta$) expression and the relationship with diabetes onset and morphological aspects. Our results suggest that GM1 administration to female NOD mice beginning at the 4th week of life is able to reduce the index of inflammatory infiltrate and consequently the expression of diabetes, modulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IFN-$\gamma$, TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$). Furthermore, GM1 increases GFAP, S-100$\beta$ and NGF in pancreas islets, factors involved in $\beta$ cell survival.},

The availability of new platforms, allowing detection of increasing numbers of cell surface markers, has challenged the traditional technique of identifying cell populations by manual gating and resulted in a growing need for the development of automated, high-dimensional analytical methods. We present a direct multivariate finite mixture modeling approach, using skew and heavy-tailed distributions, to address the complexities of flow cytometric analysis and to deal with high-dimensional cytometric data without the need for projection or transformation. We demonstrate its ability to detect rare populations, to model robustly in the presence of outliers and skew, and to perform the critical task of matching cell populations across samples that enables downstream analysis. This advance will facilitate the application of flow cytometry to new, complex biological and clinical problems.},

abstract = {Multivariate kernel density estimation provides information about structure in data. Feature significance is a technique for deciding whether features - such as local extrema - are statistically significant. This paper proposes a framework for feature significance in d-dimensional data which combines kernel density derivative estimators and hypothesis tests for modal regions. For the gradient and curvature estimators distributional properties are given, and pointwise test statistics are derived. The hypothesis tests extend the two-dimensional feature significance ideas of Godtliebsen et al. [Godtliebsen, E, Marron, J.S., Chaudhuri, P., 2002. Significance in scale space for bivariate density estimation. Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics 11, 1-21]. The theoretical framework is complemented by novel visualization for three-dimensional data. Applications to real data sets show that tests based on the kernel curvature estimators perform well in identifying modal regions. These results can be enhanced by corresponding tests with kernel gradient estimators. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Alpha-interferon (IFN-$\alpha$) is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). However, since potent inducers of IFN-$\alpha$, viruses, have been shown to modulate immune function and autoimmunity, we investigated whether administration of recombinant IFN-$\alpha$ (rIFN-$\alpha$) would inhibit the diabetic process in BB rats. The development of diabetes was significantly inhibited by injections of either 105 units or 4 × 105 units rIFN-$\alpha$. rIFN-$\alpha$ was more effective in preventing disease when injections were initiated at an earlier age (28--30 days vs 35--40 days). Histologic examination revealed a markedly lower degree of insulitis in rIFN-$\alpha$ treated rats. The mean total peripheral WBC and differential count, T-cell subsets, peripheral blood NK cell number, splenic NK cell activity, and serum cytotoxic beta cell surface antibody levels were unaltered by rIFN-$\alpha$ administration. In vitro incubation with rIFN-$\alpha$ inhibited the Con A proliferative response of mononuclear splenocytes of BB rats but not of Sprague Dawley rats. These results document that rIFN-$\alpha$ treatment potently prevents diabetes by inhibiting the development of insulitis. This paradoxical diabetes sparing effect may have significant implications for the treatment and prevention of IDDM and towards the understanding the autoimmune process.},

More knowledge is needed to prevent and treat this large group of diseases. Unravelling the genetic predisposing factors is important in this respect, and large research efforts have been initiated to reach this goal. The human MHC, also called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, is known to harbour major genetic determinants for autoimmune diseases. For several autoimmune diseases certain classical HLA class II and/or class I genes are strongly associated with disease. As a result of recent systematic screening studies additional genes and regions in the MHC, including the extended MHC, are now known to contribute to the predisposition.},

In this article, a potential cell-based immunotherapeutic strategy to induce immune tolerance by infusion of apoptotic leukocytes is presented in conjunction with a review of newly understood mechanisms of action of photopheresis and relevant information about allogeneic transfusion-related immunomodulation. The scientific rationale is discussed by examining our understanding of the role of apoptosis in self-antigen tolerance, the interaction between apoptotic bodies and antigen-presenting cells, and the subsequent induction of T regulatory cells and clonal deletion of effector T cells. Previous data on transfusion-related immunomodulation are assembled to examine a possible link between the immunosuppressive effects obtained from photopheresis and those seen post allogeneic blood transfusion. Accumulating evidence appears to support the hypothesis that photopheresis and allogeneic blood transfusion may share a mechanism of action for the induction of immunosuppression, which suggests the potential of eliciting selective immune tolerance by giving the recipient a bolus of apoptotic cells. Such immunotherapy interventions could bring significant clinical benefit to patients undergoing transplant rejection or autoimmune-related disorders and deserve further investigation as well as validation studies.},

abstract = {IL-18 has a well-established role in pro-inflammatory responses in the islets in type 1 diabetes. Here, we identify a distinctive role for IL-18 in expanding pathogenic T cells in the periphery of NOD mice. Well in advance of disease onset, the periphery of IL-18-deficient mice exhibits reduced T cell turnover, an increased prevalence of na{\"\i}ve and quiescent T cells, emergence of fewer effector T cells, and disease protection. Islet-reactive T cells fail to become activated in the lymphoid organs of mice lacking IL-18 and their rapid expansion is inhibited. IL-18 secretion by antigen presenting cells increases with advancing disease and is required for expression of its receptor on T cells. Our results demonstrate that induction of the IL-18 receptor reflects a critical stage of autoreactive T cell activation and expansion on the pathway toward effector T cell differentiation. This study therefore assigns a novel role to IL-18 for expanding the pool of islet-destructive T cells during pre-diabetes. This report highlights a new basic mechanism in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis and suggests that targeting the IL-18 pathway should be explored as a potential treatment strategy.},

Overlapping nonamer T-cell epitopes recognized by both CD4+ or CD8+ CTL clones within peptides GAD65(252-266) and GAD65(274-286) were identified as sequences bounded by GAD65(255-266) with 6/9 overlapping residues, and GAD65(276-285) with 8/9 overlapping residues, respectively, using two panels of overlapping peptide analogs in cytotoxicity assays. HLA restrictive elements of the T-cell clones were also identified using a panel of B cell lines with different HLA phenotypes as targets in cytotoxicity assays. The antigenic GAD65 peptides elicited cytotoxic responses of peptide-specific CD4+ T-cell clones in the context of HLA DRB1∗0404. The CD8+ T-cell clone specific to GAD65(255-263) was found to be restricted by HLA A3 and A11. Similarly, the CD8+ T-cell clone specific to GAD65(277-285) killed peptide-sensitized target cells expressing HLA B35 and B15. The observed HLA restriction of these overlapping epitopes implies that a tandem of [DRB1∗0404-A11(3)] and/or a tandem of [DRB1∗0404-B35(15)] might predispose CRS patients to development of IDDM.},

The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, a model for spontaneous development of type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM), was evaluated for the absorption and systemic distribution of growth factors. Radiolabeled epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor, type I (IGF-I), were administered by gavage into the stomach or by lozenge into the sublingual vasculature of either diabetic or nondiabetic mice. After a time-dependent uptake, the levels of absorption and distribution through the tissues were measured. A similar time course of EGF absorption following gavage administration was determined for NOD and C57BL/6 mice, with a maximum tissue distribution by 30-min post infusion. Diabetic NOD mice showed similar levels of IGF uptake and tissue distribution compared with nondiabetic NOD and normal healthy C57BL/6 mice, whether administered by gavage or sublingual lozenge. On the other hand, gavage uptake and tissue distribution of EGF was significantly higher in diabetic mice when compared to sublingual administration in nondiabetic NOD or C57BL/6 healthy control mice. These findings suggest that the overall potential uptake and distribution of saliva-derived growth factors in systemic wound-healing processes is retained with diabetes onset, and may offer a new avenue to treating this complication of diabetes.},

abstract = {Summary This paper presents a hypothesis of the aetiology of the increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D). This together with the global increased incidence of celiac disease (CD) and that these increases cannot be explained by genetic factors suggest a common environmental factor for these two diseases. Even though enterovirus (EV) infections are believed to trigger T1D and gluten is the trigger of CD, the increasing intake of gluten containing products all over the world could be the trigger for both diseases directly and indirectly. It has been shown that the duration of exposure to gluten is related to the prevalence of T1D. It has also been shown that T1D patients at onset have an inflammatory reaction in the gut. Hence, early diagnose of CD followed by elimination of dietary gluten will lead to a decreased incidence of T1D.},

While effector function of Th1 cells is well established, because of their inherent plasticity Th17 cells have been more controversial. Th17 cells contribute to pathogenicity, but several studies indicate that Th17 cells transfer disease through conversion to Th1 cells in vivo. CD4T cells are attracted to islets by $\beta$-cell antigens which include insulin and the two new autoantigens, chromogranin A and islet amyloid polypeptide, all proteins of the secretory granule. Peptides of insulin and ChgA bind to the NOD class II molecule in an unconventional manner and since autoantigenic peptides may typically bind to MHC with low affinity, it is postulated that post-translational modifications of $\beta$-cell peptides could contribute to the interaction between peptides, MHC, and the autoreactive TCR.},

Enhancing the signal strength of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway also induced Foxp3 expression in otherwise conventionally selected T cells. NF-$\kappa$B directly promoted the transcription of Foxp3, and upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, c-Rel, a NF-$\kappa$B family member, bound to Foxp3 enhancer region, which is specifically demethylated in natural Treg cells.

abstract = {Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice develop spontaneous autoimmune Type 1 diabetes (T1D) that results from the destruction of insulin secreting $\beta$ cells by diabetogenic T cells. The activation of autoreactive T cells occurs in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) from where effector T cells migrate to the pancreas. This study was designed to explore whether T cell populations in the NOD PLN expand in a predictable and reproducible way during disease progression. Complementary determining region (CDR) 3 length spectratype analysis of 19 TCR V$\beta$ families was used to identify the relative frequency of T populations in PLN of 4 and 10 week old NOD mice and mice at T1D onset. Significant and highly reproducible changes in specific T cell populations were detected in 14 of V$\beta$ families tested at all stages of disease. However, of these, the CDR3 spectratype of only four V$\beta$ families was significantly more perturbed at T1D onset than in 10 week old mice. Intriguingly, when diabetes was induced in 10 week old mice with cyclophosphamide (CYP) the same four V$\beta$ families, V$\beta$5.1, V$\beta$9, V$\beta$10, and V$\beta$15, were again significantly more perturbed than in the untreated non-diabetic age matched mice. Taken together the data show that while T cell responses in PLN of NOD mice are heterogeneous, they are ordered and consistent throughout disease development. The finding that within this heterogeneous response four V$\beta$ families are significantly more perturbed in diabetic mice, whether spontaneous or induced, strongly suggests their selection as part of the disease process.},

We have further investigated the influence of Igs on the development of autoimmunity by testing the effect of polyclonal mouse-Ig or monoclonal, natural antibodies derived from normal, neonatal BALBc mice. We found that repeated administration of high doses of polyclonal Ig (of xenogenic or isogenic origin), given at birth, inhibits the development of insulitis, as well as diabetes. Furthermore, single injections of moderate doses of isogenic, natural monoclonal antibodies (mAb) administered at the same age, while failing to significantly alter the degree of insulitis, efficiently prevent the development of disease. The effect of mAbs was found to be related to V-region specificity, as only some mAbs of a given isotype and origin had the observed effect.},

In this review, we summarize research showing that naturally occurring (nTreg) and induced Treg (iTreg) cell subsets, and in particular CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells, are critical in the control of immune responses in rodents and humans. We also discuss the cellular and molecular factors that affect CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cell development, homeostasis, and function and consequential immunity to self and non-self antigens. Recent studies have shed light in our understanding of the development of novel methods of autoimmune disease prevention and treatment via enhancing and re-establishing Treg-mediated dominant control over self-reactive T cells in animal models and humans.},

The development of these autoimmune diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes, is known to be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors which have been considered to play a role include infectious agents such as viruses or bacteria. The search for a common initiating infection in the aetiology of Type 1 diabetes as proved thus far inconclusive. An alternative way of considering a role for infection is that infection may have historically prevented the development of autoimmune disease. In the developing world changes have occurred such that many chronic infections have been eliminated and this may have led to the emergence of autoimmune pathology. Evidence in support of this hypothesis is considered here and factors governing the development of autoimmunity compared with those which might have influenced the development of childhood leukaemia.},

abstract = {Diabetes is a major risk factor for coronary and peripheral artery diseases. Although diabetic patients often present with advanced forms of these diseases, it is not known whether the compensatory mechanisms to vascular ischemia are affected in this condition. Accordingly, we sought to determine whether diabetes could: 1) impair the development of new collateral vessel formation in response to tissue ischemia and 2) inhibit cytokine-induced therapeutic neovascularization. Hindlimb ischemia was created by femoral artery ligation in nonobese diabetic mice (NOD mice, n = 20) and in control C57 mice (n = 20). Hindlimb perfusion was evaluated by serial laser Doppler studies after the surgery. In NOD mice, measurement of the Doppler flow ratio between the ischemic and the normal limb indicated that restoration of perfusion in the ischemic hindlimb was significantly impaired. At day 14 after surgery, Doppler flow ratio in the NOD mice was 0.49 $\pm$ 0.04 versus 0.73 $\pm$ 0.06 for the C57 mice (P ≤ 0.005). This impairment in blood flow recovery persisted throughout the duration of the study with Doppler flow ratio values at day 35 of 0.50 $\pm$ 0.05 versus0.90 $\pm$ 0.07 in the NOD and C57 mice, respectively (P ≤ 0.001). CD31 immunostaining confirmed the laser Doppler data by showing a significant reduction in capillary density in the NOD mice at 35 days after surgery (302 $\pm$ 4 capillaries/mm2 versus 782 $\pm$ 78 in C57 mice (P ≤ 0.005). The reduction in neovascularization in the NOD mice was the result of a lower level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the ischemic tissues, as assessed by Northern blot, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The central role of VEGF was confirmed by showing that normal levels of neovascularization (compared with C57) could be achieved in NOD mice that had been supplemented for this growth factor via intramuscular injection of an adenoviral vector encoding for VEGF. We conclude that 1) diabetes impairs endogenous neovascularization of ischemic tissues; 2) the impairment in new blood vessel formation results from reduced expression of VEGF; and 3) cytokine supplementation achieved by intramuscular adeno-VEGF gene transfer restores neovascularization in a mouse model of diabetes.},

Accordingly, young nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice injected with a single low dose of streptozotocin (SZ), a drug cytotoxic for $\beta$ cells, exhibited impaired T cell responses to islet antigens and were protected from spontaneous diabetes. Furthermore, $\beta$ cell apoptosis was necessary for protection since SZ did not protect RIP-CrmA transgenic NOD mice in which $\beta$ cells expressed the caspase inhibitor CrmA. Our results support a model in which apoptosis of pancreatic $\beta$ cells induces the development of regulatory cells leading to the tolerization of self-reactive T cells and protection from diabetes.},

At present, the notion that early atherogenesis is largely dependent on sustained hyperglycemia remains in question. We hypothesize that an alteration in T lymphocyte homeostasis may result in early vascular inflammation, which might amplify subsequent blood vessel injury in euglycemia. Methods A murine model of carotid arterial ligation was employed to induce neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) in C57/Bl6 (non-autoimmune) and non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Additionally, adoptive transfer of NOD splenocytes into immunodeficient NOD mice (NOD.scid) was undertaken to evaluate the influence of restored autoimmunity on NIH development. Results Interestingly, compared with C57/Bl6 mice, the NOD demonstrate a significant increase in neointimal area. Conversely, the NOD.scid mice (immunodeficient control) reveal almost no evidence of vascular injury. While evidence of early vascular inflammation can be detected in the injured NOD vasculature, uninjured contralateral vessels and those of the NOD.scid have minimal T cell infiltration. Following reconstitution of autoimmune responses via NOD splenocyte adoptive transfer, accelerated vascular pathology is restored. Conclusions These observations suggest that autoimmunity, in the setting of impending hyperglycemia, may contribute to accelerated vascular inflammation and subsequent pathology.},

It is mainly through its actions on dendritic cells (DCs), that 1,25(OH)2D3 changes the function of potentially autoreactive T lymphocytes. In contrast, early life treatment (from 3 to 70 days of age) of NOD mice with vitamin D or 1,25(OH)2D3 did not influence final diabetes incidence at 200 days of age. Also in spontaneous diabetic BB rats, diabetes could not be prevented by early life treatment (from 3 to 50 days of age) with vitamin D (1000{\&}{\#}xa0;IU per day) or 1,25(OH)2D3 (0.2{\&}{\#}xa0;$\mu$g/kg per day or 1{\&}{\#}xa0;$\mu$g/kg per 2 days). However, when NOD mice were made vitamin D deficient in early life (until 100 days of age), diabetes onset occurred earlier and final incidence was increased. These data further support a role for vitamin D and its metabolites in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice.},

abstract = {The NOD mouse has been an important model of type 1 diabetes and autoimmune diseases for over 20 years. Experimental and genetic manipulations of the NOD mouse have demonstrated a broad susceptibility to multiple autoimmune syndromes. This predisposition to autoimmunity is due to defects in both central and peripheral tolerance. The defect of central tolerance is likely secondary to improper negative selection mediated by the unique MHC Class II molecule, I-Ag7 as well as intrinsic T cell signaling defects. The genetic basis for impaired peripheral tolerance is controlled by over 20 susceptibility loci termed insulin-dependent diabetes (idd) loci. The maintenance of peripheral tolerance is impaired by alterations in T cell signaling and apoptosis. In addition, insufficient co-stimulation from accessory cells, and defective regulatory T cells, may promote the production of autoreactive T cells.},

Although infiltration occurs around islets in males, the incidence of overt diabetes is much less (about 1%) and suggests that there may be more effective regulatory circuits in these animals. This possibility was examined by using splenocytes from young males to reconstitute irradiated male recipients 6 d before the transfer of diabetogenic spleen cells from spontaneously diabetic females. Those animals which were not reconstituted with male spleen cells developed diabetes 3--5 weeks later, whereas the majority of the reconstituted mice remained normoglycaemic. Characterization of the protective population demonstrated a role for CD4+ T cells. An additional observation was that splenocytes from young normal males also contained a population of non-T cells which could advance the diabetogenic transfer of disease by at least a week.},

abstract = {SummaryContext Curative therapy for diabetes mellitus mainly implies replacement of functional insulin-producing pancreatic $\beta$ cells, with pancreas or islet-cell transplants. However, shortage of donor organs spurs research into alternative means of generating $\beta$ cells from islet expansion, encapsulated islet xenografts, human islet cell-lines, and stem cells. Stem-cell therapy here implies the replacement of diseased or lost cells from progeny of pluripotent or multipotent cells. Both embryonic stem cells (derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst) and adult stem cells (found in the postnatal organism) have been used to generate surrogate $\beta$ cells or otherwise restore $\beta$-cell functioning. Starting point Recently, Andreas Lechner and colleagues failed to see transdifferentiation into pancreatic $\beta$ cells after transplantation of bone-marrow cells into mice (Diabetes 2004; 53: 616--23). Last year, Jayaraj Rajagopal and colleagues failed to derive $\beta$ cells from embryonic stem cells (Science 2003; 299: 363). However, others have seen such effects. Where next? As in every emerging field in biology, early reports seem confusing and conflicting. Embryonic and adult stem cells are potential sources for $\beta$-cell replacement and merit further scientific investigation. Discrepancies between different results need to be reconciled. Fundamental processes in determining the differentiation pathways of stem cells remain to be elucidated, so that rigorous and reliable differentiation protocols can be established. Encouraging studies in rodent models may ultimately set the stage for large-animal studies and translational investigation.},

We aimed to replicate these findings by genotyping both large family and case-control data sets and by using previously published data. Gene-gene interaction tests were performed using linear regression models in cases only. We did not find any single-locus associations with T1D and did not obtain evidence of gene-gene interaction.

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder resulting from lymphocyte-mediated destruction of insulin-producing $\beta$ cells in pancreas. Natural killer T cells are regulatory immune components controlling autoreactivity and immune homeostasis. Although early studies supported that amelioration of autoimmune diabetes by natural killer T cells was associated with Th1/2 shift, other Th2-independent regulatory mechanisms were also suggested. Since natural killer T cells are critical for the generation of CD8+ regulatory T cells controlling anterior chamber-associated immune deviation and CD8+ regulatory T cells also participate in suppression of immune responses like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we investigate whether the similar suppressive effects are involved in $\alpha$-galactosylceramide-induced immune tolerance in non-obese diabetic mice. We demonstrate that repeated exposure of $\alpha$-galactosylceramide reveals a hyporesponsiveness of total or antigen-presenting cells-depleted splenocytes upon anti-CD3/28 antibodies stimulation. The dispensability of dendritic cells in the hyporesponsiveness is consistent with the comparable expression of costimulatory molecules on CD11c+ subsets between $\alpha$-galactosylceramide- and vehicle-treated mice. $\alpha$-Galactosylceramide treatment not only affects the effector T cell subsets and their cytokine production but also increases the secretion of transforming growth factor-$\beta$ by splenocytes, implying the suppressive regulation. The adoptive transfer experiments demonstrate the suppressive effect of T cells from $\alpha$-galactosylceramide-treated non-obese diabetic mice when co-transferred with vehicle-treated littermates. Finally, it reveals that CD8+ subset among antigen-presenting cells-depleted splenocytes tends to confer the suppression since the protective ability vanishes upon withdrawal of CD8+ subset. These results suggest that repeated exposure of $\alpha$-galactosylceramide ameliorates autoimmune diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice mediated by CD8+ T cell-associated suppression.},

abstract = {Summary Pancreatic islet transplantation experiments in diabetic BB rats have defined a formidable obstacle to the successful use of therapeutic islet replacement for IDDM: an anti-beta cell autoimmune response directed at the transplanted islet tissue. Importantly this response was subsequently documented to also occur in humans following pancreas transplantation and in NOD mice after islet grafting. The model of recurrent disease has proven to be very useful in probing the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes. The fact that the response is rapid and consistently reproducible, and allows easy manipulation of the target beta cells makes for an ideal investigative system. The model of recurrent diabetogenesis in BB rats has determined that islets relocated to either the renal subcapsule or abdominal testis site might be exempt from autoimmune damage. Moreover, pancreatic grafts may be less vulnerable to autoimmunity than isolated islets. Also of potential relevance to the clinical situation are the data from BB rat studies which suggest an MHC restricted autoimmune process. However, since other studies favour an non-MHC specific islet damage the question may ultimately need to be resolved by human studies. In both the NOD and BB models immunosuppressive agents have been identified which successfully eliminate the threat of autoimmune damage to transplanted beta cells. In the NOD the efficacy of anti-L3T4 mAb directly implicates T helper cells in the response. In the BB the effectiveness of mAb OX-8 administration just as clearly defines the participation of either CTL or NK like cells in beta cell damage. Use of either or both types of monoclonal antibody could ultimately find application in human islet or pancreas transplantation.},

DNA from 190 patients with T1D and their families and 96 control individuals were genotyped for CTLA4 exon 1 polymorphism and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)--DQB1*0201 and *0302 haplotypes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification--restriction enzyme analysis and PCR amplification that used sequence-specific primers, respectively.

The GG genotype was also significantly higher among patients (12.6%) than in controls (4.2%). $\chi$2 analysis and family-based association studies were performed and suggested the association of CTLA4 exon 1 G polymorphism with T1D (p = 0.0229). Furthermore, in HLA-DQB1*0201--positive patients with T1D, the GG and AA genotypes were higher and lower, respectively, than those found in control individuals.

Single injection of STZ-exposed islets significantly (P{\&}lt;0.03) decreased the incidence of diabetes in pre-diabetic NOD mice compared to control groups. At 40 weeks of age, the onset of diabetes in NOD mice injected with STZ-treated islets was 16% (3/19) compared to 88% (14/16) in mice that received islets exposed to citrate buffer and 84% (26/31) in those mice injected with saline. Histological examination of the pancreases from normoglycemic mice given STZ-treated islets revealed numerous intact islets devoid of mononuclear cell infiltration while pancreases from control groups contained few intact islets infiltrated with mononuclear cells. This study demonstrates that immunization of pre-diabetic female NOD mice with syngeneic islets exposed to STZ prevents insulitis and onset of autoimmune diabetes.

However, combination of probucol with the anti- inflammatory corticosteroid, deflazacort, produced an early synergistic effect, delaying diabetes onset by 3 weeks, and a later additive effect, decreasing diabetes incidence from 68% (17 of 25 mice) to 23% (6 of 26 mice, p{\&}lt;0.005). Protection against diabetes by the combination of probucol and deflazacort was associated with a significant decrease in pancreatic islet infiltration by macrophages/lymphocytes (insulitis) and prevention of islet $\beta$ cell loss.},

abstract = {Summary Maintenance of lymphoid homeostasis in a number of immunological and inflammatory contexts is served by a variety of regulatory T (Treg) cell subtypes and depends on interaction of the transcription factor FoxP3 with specific transcriptional cofactors. We report that a commonly used insertional mutant of FoxP3 (GFP-Foxp3) modified its molecular interactions, blocking HIF-1$\alpha$ but increasing IRF4 interactions. The transcriptional profile of these Treg cells was subtly altered, with an overrepresentation of IRF4-dependent transcripts. In keeping with IRF4-dependent function of Treg cells to preferentially suppress T cell help to B cells and Th2 and Th17 cell-type differentiation, GFP-FoxP3 mice showed a divergent susceptibility to autoimmune disease: protection against antibody-mediated arthritis in the K/BxN model, but greater susceptibility to diabetes on the NOD background. Thus, specific subfunctions of Treg cells and the immune diseases they regulate can be influenced by FoxP3's molecular interactions, which result in divergent immunoregulation.},

abstract = {Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. The effector mechanisms essentially involve cytokine-mediated inflammation ultimately leading to $\beta$-cell destruction. Several candidate autoantigens have been delineated for both the pathogenic T-cell response and the nonpathogenic antibody response used for disease prediction. Because of antigen spreading, it is not yet clear which of these antigens are involved in the triggering of the autoimmune response. In any case, this TH1 autoimmune response is amplified and perpetuated by an immune dysregulation involving TH2 cells. Both effector and regulatory mechanisms are placed under the tight control of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and non-MHC genes.

abstract = {Introduction: Insulin peptide B:9-23 is a major autoantigen in type 1 diabetes that induces insulin autoantibodies and prevents diabetes in the NOD. However, immunization with peptide without adjuvant may be insufficient to reverse disease or induce long-term tolerance. Furthermore, recent experience has demonstrated the potential dangers of disease exacerbation or anaphylaxis with peptide immunotherapy. Methods: Combination therapy of B:9-23 with a nondepleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (YTS 177.9) was studied in female NOD mice from 4 through 6 weeks of age. Injections of either B:9-23 in saline, YTS 177.9 antibody, or both peptide and antibody were given to mice. Results: By 52 weeks follow-up, 40% of B:9-23-treated, 100% of YTS177.9-treated, and 70% of B:9-23 and YTS177.9 combination-treated mice remained diabetes-free. IAA, both spontaneous and induced by B:9-23, was almost completely suppressed in mice receiving YTS 177.9. In addition to suppression of IAA expression, anti-B:9-23 peptide antibodies are also suppressed in mice receiving B:9-23 with YTS 177.9, compared to B:9-23 alone. Conclusion: A brief course of the nondepleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (YTS 177.9) in NOD mice confers long-term protection from diabetes and insulitis and profoundly blocks spontaneous and B:9-23 peptide-induced insulin autoantibodies.},

In this study we investigated whether VDR gene polymorphisms influence nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in individuals with T1D. Methods In 93 T1D patients, VDR polymorphisms on FokI F{\&}gt;f, BsmI B{\&}gt;b, ApaI A{\&}gt;a, and TaqI T{\&}gt;t were determined in DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and a nasal swab was obtained to detect colonization by S. aureus. A repeat swab was obtained in 76/93 subjects for the estimation of persistent S. aureus carriage. Results The prevalence of S. aureus nasal colonization was 31.2% and the prevalence of persistent carriage was 25%. The presence of TaqI T allele was related to higher rates of S. aureus colonization, and TaqI TT homozygotes were more colonized (48.5% vs. 21.7%; p 0.007; OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.36--8.52) and more persistent carriers (37.9% vs. 17.0%; p 0.039; OR 2.98, 95% CI 1.02--8.67). The presence of ApaI A allele was related to lower rates of S. aureus colonization, and ApaI AA homozygotes were less colonized (17.6% vs. 39.0%; p 0.026; OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12--0.94) and less persistent carriers (11.5% vs. 32%; p 0.043; OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07--1.06). No differences were observed for BsmI and FokI genotypes. Conclusions Our findings suggest that VDR polymorphisms may be associated with nasal carriage of S. aureus in individuals with T1D, and further contribute to the better understanding of the immunomodulatory role of vitamin D in the human host's response and susceptibility to infection.},

With regard to this, steroid influence on the immune system, in particular sex steroids and glucocorticoids, has been known for a long time. Sex steroids are part of the mechanism underlying the immune sexual dimorphism, as particularly emphasized in autoimmune diseases. Immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are now considered a physiological negative feedback loop to cytokines produced during an immune and/or inflammatory response. Psychosocial factors may play a role in the development of immunologically-mediated diseases, e.g. autoimmune diseases. The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, that develops an immunologically-mediated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an interesting model to study the role of endogenous steroids. Insulitis is present in both sexes, but diabetes has a strong preponderance in females. Hormonal alteration, such as castration, modulates the incidence of diabetes, whereas environmental factors, such as stress, accelerate the disease. In the present paper, we have reviewed the role of gender, sex steroid hormones, stress and glucocorticoids in autoimmunity as well as analyzed their different levels of actions and interrelationships, focusing particular attention on the immunologically-mediated IDDM of the NOD mouse.},

As we show here, murine B cells can efficiently be transduced by lentiviral, VSV-G-pseudotyped vectors without the necessity of prior activation. Culture with LPS gave enhanced transduction efficiencies but led to the upregulation of CD86 and proliferation of the cells. Transduction of naive B cells by lentiviral vectors was dependent on multiplicity of infection and did not lead to a concomitant activation. Furthermore, the transduced cells could be used for studies in the NOD mouse system without altering the onset of diabetes. We conclude that lentiviral gene transfer into naive B cells is a powerful tool for manipulation of B cells for therapeutic applications.},

abstract = {Summary The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, encompassing 3.5 Mb of DNA from the centromeric HLA-DPB2 locus to the telomeric HLA-F locus on chromosome 6p21, encodes a major part of the genetic predisposition to develop type 1 diabetes, designated ``IDDM1.'' A primary role for allelic variation of the class II HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 loci has been established. However, studies of animals and humans have indicated that other, unmapped, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)--linked genes are participating in IDDM1. The strong linkage disequilibrium between genes in this complex makes mapping a difficult task. In the present paper, we report on the approach we have devised to circumvent the confounding effects of disequilibrium between class II alleles and alleles at other MHC loci. We have scanned 12 Mb of the MHC and flanking chromosome regions with microsatellite polymorphisms and analyzed the transmission of these marker alleles to diabetic probands from parents who were homozygous for the alleles of the HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 genes. Our analysis, using three independent family sets, suggests the presence of an additional type I diabetes gene (or genes). This approach is useful for the analysis of other loci linked to common diseases, to verify if a candidate polymorphism can explain all of the association of a region or if the association is due to two or more loci in linkage disequilibrium with each other.},

abstract = {Inflammation can activate self-reactive CD8+ T cells and induce autoimmunity. Here we show in a CD8+ T cell-mediated model of type 1 diabetes that CD4+CD25+ Treg cells prevent $\beta$ cell destruction following localized inflammation in the islets of Langerhans. These Treg cells accumulate preferentially in the pancreatic lymph nodes and islets but not other lymph nodes or spleen. PLN-derived Treg cells are extremely potent; only 2 × 103 cells are needed to prevent diabetes development, and their capacity to regulate is dependent on TNF-related activation induced cytokine-receptor activator of NF$\kappa$B signals. Indeed, blockade of this pathway results in decreased frequency of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells in the PLN, resulting in intra-islet differentiation of CD8+ T cells into CTLs and rapid progression to diabetes.},

abstract = {The heterogeneity between young- and adult-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) is well known, but not well understood. We approach this question through mathematical formulation and analysis of the dynamic interactions between the immune cells and the pancreatic islet $\beta$-cells that lead to the $\beta$-cell destruction. Utilizing the perturbation expansion method we investigate the dynamic stability of our system under fast and slow $\beta$-cell turnover limits. We find that if autoimmunity is initiated when the turnover is slow (adult age), a stable steady state can exist with reduced number of $\beta$-cells, where the $\beta$-cell regeneration balances the ongoing autoimmune destruction. This implies that a slow disease process is possible. In contrast, if autoimmunity occurs when the $\beta$-cell turnover is rapid (young age), such a stable state will never be attained and the destruction will progress unabated, leading to an acute disease onset. The major findings of our model are consistent with clinical observations, and it offers an explanation for the dynamic and phenotypic heterogeneity between young- and adult-onset T1D. More importantly, the model analyses point out that pathways regulating $\beta$-cell turnover can be new targets to interfere with the disease process of T1D.},

DCs were generated from the bone marrow of GM-CSF-treated (GM.BMDCs) and PBS-treated (PBS.BMDCs) NOD mice and were assessed for their ability to acquire tolerogenic properties. Upon LPS stimulation, GM.BMDCs became fully mature, expressed high levels of PD-L1 and produced more IL-10 and less IL-12p70 and IFN-$\gamma$ than PBS.BMDCs. In addition, LPS-stimulated GM.BMDCs possessed a reduced capacity to activate diabetogenic CD8+ T cells in a PD-1/PD-L1-dependent manner. A single injection of LPS-stimulated GM.BMDCs in NOD mice resulted in long-term protection from diabetes, in contrast to LPS-stimulated PBS.BMDCs. Our results showed that GM-CSF-treatment acted on bone marrow precursors to skew their differentiation into tDCs that protected NOD mice against diabetes.},

Our study verified the effect of allogeneic BMSCs (ICR) transferred into NOD mice on blood glucose and CD4+ T cells subsets function. In vivo experiment, BMSCs could decrease blood glucose, weaken lymphocytes proliferation. In vitro experiment, the distribution of CD4+ T cell subsets was changed after co-culture with BMSCs, resulting in a greater frequency of Treg cells and reduced representation of Th17 cells. After TGF-$\beta$ blockade, CD4+ T cells differentiated along a route favoring development of Th17, but not Treg cells. Thus, NOD can be treated by BMSCs which changes the distribution of CD4+ T cells, increases the number of Treg cells, and inhibits the differentiation of Th17 cells. And the positive effects of allogeneic BMSCs in the treatment of NOD mice depend on the regulation of TGF-$\beta$ secreted by BMSCs.},

abstract = {The importance of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) in maintaining immune homeostasis has been directly demonstrated in vivo by their manipulation in a number of autoimmune disease models in the mouse. In the study of human regulatory cells, we have found that the cells that consistently demonstrate the in vitro regulatory activity most similar to that described for murine cells in vitro are best identified by restricting the isolation of CD25+CD4 T cells to those cells expressing only the highest levels of CD25, representing approximately 2--3% of total CD4 T cells. Thus, it is the CD4+CD25high subset that exhibits the in vitro characteristics that are identical to the CD4+CD25+ regulatory cells initially characterized in mice. Furthermore, the cells expressing medium to low levels of CD25 not only do not exhibit suppressive activity directly ex vivo, but also actually contain a significant proportion of CD62L−CD4 T cells which are believed to be in vivo activated T cells. Due to the inherent difficulties in using CD25 as a marker for the purification of Treg cells, the finding that selection of the CD25high subset of CD4+CD25+ T cells minimizes the co-isolation of contaminating activated CD4 T cells is important for future studies of these Treg cells in human disease. In order to perform these studies, we first had to establish a highly reproducible `micro in vitro co-culture' assay system to enable the functional analysis of high-purity, but low-yield regulatory populations derived from FACS sorting. With this system in place, we are poised to dissect the potential heterogeneity of mechanisms employed by highly specific subpopulations of CD4+CD25+ cells.},

abstract = {In the thymus of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, the expression of the autoimmune regulator (Aire) gene varies with age, and its down-regulation in young mice precedes the later emergence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). In addition, the insulin (Ins2) peripheral tissue antigen (PTA) gene, which is Aire-dependent, is also deregulated in these mice. Based in these findings, we hypothesized that the imbalance in PTA gene expression in the thymus can be associated with slight variations in Aire transcript levels. To test this, we used siRNA to knockdown Aire by in vivo electro-transfection of the thymus of BALB/c mice. The efficiency of the electro-transfection was monitored by assessing the presence of irrelevant Cy3-labeled siRNA in the thymic stroma. Importantly, Aire-siRNA reached medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) down-regulating Aire. As expected, the in vivo Aire knockdown was partial and transient; the maximum 59% inhibition occurred in 48{\&}{\#}xa0;h. The Aire knockdown was sufficient to down-regulate PTA genes; however, surprisingly, several others, including Ins2, were up-regulated. The modulation of these genes after in vivo Aire knockdown was comparable to that observed in NOD mice before the emergence of T1D. The in vitro transfections of 3.10 mTEC cells with Aire siRNA resulted in samples featuring partial (69%) and complete (100%) Aire knockdown. In these Aire siRNA-transfected 3.10 mTECs, the expression of PTA genes, including Ins2, was down-regulated. This suggests that the expression profile of PTA genes in mTECs is affected by fine changes in the transcription level of Aire.},

abstract = {Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) may be present at the onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D), increasing both its morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of this complication at the clinical presentation of T1D, as well as possible interfering factors in a multi-ethnic population from Brazil. We have reviewed the medical charts of 545 individuals with T1D diagnosed between 1968 and 2006 from two major local diabetes treatment centers. DKA occurred in 179 patients (32.8%) at the onset of T1D. The frequency of DKA was higher in non-white than white individuals (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.0001) and in the younger age groups (≤5 y/o and 6--10 y/o; p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.015). The prevalence of DKA at the onset of the disease did not change over the past four decades, except for a higher prevalence in patients diagnosed since 2000 when compared to those that had hyperglycemia detected in the 1990s (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.019). To conclude, a significant proportion of individuals present DKA at the onset of T1D in this population, especially very young children and non-white individuals. Unfortunately, the frequency of DKA has not progressively declined in the past decades. An improvement in the educational programs for detection of early signs and symptoms might help to change this scenario.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:A genomic catalogue of protein-protein interactions is a rich source of information, particularly for exploring the relationships between proteins. Numerous systems-wide and small-scale experiments have been conducted to identify interactions; however, our knowledge of all interactions for any one species is incomplete, and alternative means to expand these network maps is needed. We therefore took a comparative biology approach to predict protein-protein interactions across five species (human, mouse, fly, worm, and yeast) and developed InterologFinder for research biologists to easily navigate this data. We also developed a confidence score for interactions based on available experimental evidence and conservation across species.

RESULTS:The connectivity of the resultant networks was determined to have scale-free distribution, small-world properties, and increased local modularity, indicating that the added interactions do not disrupt our current understanding of protein network structures. We show examples of how these improved interactomes can be used to analyze a genome-scale dataset (RNAi screen) and to assign new function to proteins. Predicted interactions within this dataset were tested by co-immunoprecipitation, resulting in a high rate of validation, suggesting the high quality of networks produced.

CONCLUSIONS:Protein-protein interactions were predicted in five species, based on orthology. An InteroScore, a score accounting for homology, number of orthologues with evidence of interactions, and number of unique observations of interactions, is given to each known and predicted interaction. Our website http://www.interologfinder.org provides research biologists intuitive access to this data.},

abstract = {Diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of the $\beta$ cells in the pancreas. We have previously reported that transgenic expression of interleukin-4 (IL-4) counterregulates the disease process, completely protecting NOD mice from insulitis and diabetes. Here we demonstrate the presence of autoreactivity but lack of pathogenicity of the IL-4--regulated lymphocytes. The importance of T cell diversity for the protective effect of IL-4 is demonstrated through breeding with transgenic BDC2.5 mice, which have an almost exclusively monoclonal T cell repertoire. Limitation of T cell diversity abrogated the protection by IL-4. We suggest that ``immune deviation'' in NOD-IL-4 mice is mediated by the pancreatic tissue itself, which causes activation of distinct, nonpathogenic T cell specificities.},

abstract = {Major advances in large-scale yeast two-hybrid screening have provided a global view of binary protein-protein interactions across species as dissimilar as human, yeast, and bacteria. Remarkably, these analyses have revealed that all species studied have a degree distribution of protein-protein binding that is approximately scale-free (varies as a power law) even though their evolutionary divergence times differ by billions of years. The universal power law shows only the surface of the rich information harbored by these high-throughput data. We develop a detailed mathematical model of the protein-protein interaction network based on association free energy, the biochemical quantity that determines protein-protein interaction strength. This model reproduces the degree distribution of all of the large-scale yeast two-hybrid data sets available and allows us to extract the distribution of free energy, the likelihood that a pair of proteins of a given species will bind. We find that across-species interactomes have significant differences that reflect the strengths of the protein-protein interaction. Our results identify a global evolutionary shift: more evolved organisms have weaker binary protein-protein binding. This result is consistent with the evolution of increased protein unfoldedness and challenges the dogma that only specific protein-protein interactions can be biologically functional.},

abstract = {Aim To describe coverage, cost and care of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in 2 regions of China -- Beijing and Shantou -- including: Estimating the numbers of people with T1D diabetes. Estimating the economic burden of T1D and financial barriers to care. Identifying scale of necessary government investment to improve health care coverage. Defining the burden of disease based on clinical outcomes. Describing the education and care experience of people with T1D with comparison to selected clinical practice guidelines. Describing the information processes associated with diabetes care and education. Methods This is a mixed-methods descriptive study with three arms -- coverage, cost and care. It is taking place in 4 tertiary hospitals, 3 secondary hospitals and 4 primary health facilities in Beijing, and 2 tertiary hospitals, 2 secondary hospitals and 2 primary health centres in Shantou, China. Two additional hospitals are involved in the coverage arm of the study. T1D participants are recruited from a 3-year list generated by each hospital and from those attending the outpatient clinic or admitted to the inpatient ward. Participants also include health care professionals and government officials. To determine coverage of care, a list of people with T1D is being developed including information on diagnosis, age, sex and vital status. The age and sex distribution will be compared with the expected distribution. To estimate the economic burden of T1D three groups of costs will be calculated -- direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs and indirect costs from different perspectives of analysis (patients and their families, health system, insurer and societal perspective). The data are being collected from people with T1D (patient--parents face-to-face interviews), hospital billing departments, medical records and government officials using a combined ``top-down, bottom-up'' approach developed to validate the data. Quality of life is assessed using the EQ-5D tool and burden of disease is measured based on clinical outcomes and complications. Standard care will be defined, costed and compared to the cost of current care identified within the study to determine the investment required to improve outcomes. The third arm includes three components -- health policy, clinical care and education, and information management. Face-to-face, semi-structured interviews are conducted with people with T1D (for those {\&}lt;15 years of age parents are interviewed), health care professionals, senior hospital management and government officials. The core Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Measure plus an additional 6 questions from the revised SDSCA scale are used to assess patient self-care. A medical records audit tool is used to assess care [7]. Clinical outcomes and self-care activities will be analysed for associations with care and education. Information management and care processes will be described using the Standard for Integration Definition for Function Modelling (IDEF0) [8]. Progress to date At the time of writing (early October) the 3-year case list includes 1269 people with type 1 diabetes from Beijing and 481 people for Shantou, a total of 1750. In addition, two hundred and twenty people with T1D or their parents participated in face-to-face interviews in Beijing and 183 in Shantou, a total of 403. Practical preliminary conclusions Key implementation considerations were identified early in the project. Project success is dependent on strong local partnerships with local opinion leaders and key officials. It is important that a physician is the first point of contact to build the case list and recruit participants. July, August and January are peak months for recruiting school-age children in the Children's Hospital as this is school vacation period when they are more likely to attend clinics.},

In all mice, pancreatic GAD 65 expression declined with age. In 5-week-old NOD mice, a clear difference was detected between males and females. This sexual dimorphism may explain the absence of tolerance to GAD 65 in the NOD female which could contribute to autoimmune destruction of $\beta$ cells in the pancreas and subsequent development of diabetes.},

abstract = {We had earlier hypothesized, if parents originated from previously isolated populations that had selected against different critical susceptibility genes for a polygenic disease, their offspring could have a greater risk of that disease than either parent. We therefore studied parents of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). We found that parents who transmitted HLA-DR3 to HLA-DR3/DR4 patients had different HLA-A allele frequencies on the non-transmitted HLA haplotype than HLA-DR4-transmitters. HLA-DR3-positive parents also had different insulin (INS) gene allele frequencies than HLA-DR4-positive parents. Parent pairs of patients had greater self-reported ethnicity disparity than parent pairs in control families. Although there was an excess of HLA-DR3/DR4 heterozygotes among type 1 diabetes patients, there were significantly fewer HLA-DR3/DR4 heterozygous parents of patients than expected. These findings are consistent with HLA-DR and INS VNTR alleles marking both disease susceptibility and separate Caucasian parental subpopulations. Our hypothesis thus explains some seemingly disconnected puzzling phenomena, including (1) the rising world-wide incidence of T1D, (2) the excess of HLA-DR3/DR4 heterozygotes among patients, (3) the changing frequency of HLA-DR3/DR4 heterozygotes and of susceptibility alleles in general in patients over the past several decades, and (4) the association of INS alleles with specific HLA-DR alleles in patients with T1D.},

The ILI mouse serologically shared the same MHC Class I and Class II as the NOD mouse. Insulitis was defined as islets invaded by lymphoid cells. Periductular, perivascular and peri-insular lymphoid cell infiltrations were often observed in NOD mice and appear to be the initial lesion leading to insulitis. Such lesions, however, were found in 1-year-old ICR, ILI, NON and Cataract Shionogi (CTS) mice of the NOD's sister strain. The lymphoid cells did not invade the islets in ICR, ILI, NON and CTS mice. The incidence of insulitis was 0% in F1 generations and 40% in female backcrosses (BC) [(ILI × NOD)F1 × NOD] at 9 weeks of age, 48 and 50% in BC[(NON × NOD)F1 × NOD] and BC[(C3HHe × NOD)F1 × NOD] at 1 year of age, respectively. Backcross animals were typed for the MHC to investigate correlation between the development of insulitis and MHC haplotypes. Among the backcross females with insulitis, approximately half the animals were heterozygous for MHC(nonnod) in BC[(NON × NOD)F1 × NOD] and MHC(knod) in BC[(C3H × NOD)F1 × NOD]. Among the backcross females with no insulitis, approximately half the animals were homozygous for MHC(nodnod) in BC[(NON × NOD)F1 × NOD] and in BC[(C3H × NOD)F1 × NOD]. The results suggest that a single recessive non-MHC diabetogenic gene determines the development of insulitis regardless of NOD MHC homozygosity or heterozygosity.},

Herein, we investigated the effect of specific TLR3 and TLR7 agonists, poly (I:C) and R837, individually and in combination, on uterine immune cell function and their subsequent effects on pregnancy outcome. Allogeneic pregnancies in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse{\&}{\#}xa0;×{\&}{\#}xa0;C57BL/6 and wild-type BALB/c{\&}{\#}xa0;×{\&}{\#}xa0;C57BL/6 model were used. An additive increase in embryo resorption was observed after induction with both poly (I:C) and R837, and was associated with elevated numbers of both TNF-$\alpha$- and IFN-$\gamma$-producing CD45+ cells in the uterus. Further examination showed that while cytokine expression was detected in both CD3+ cells and CD49b+ cells in BALB/c mice, NOD mouse cells behaved differently. In NOD mice, elevated cytokine expression was attributed to CD3+ T cells, with no response detected in the CD49b+ NK cells. The additive effect of combined agonists was partially inhibited by the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SP600125 and almost completely abrogated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK inhibitor PD98059. These results suggest that increased TLR3 and TLR7 signals are transmitted via Th1-type T cells, rather than NK cells, in NOD mice. Furthermore, the ERK MAPK pathway may be critical in TLR3 and TLR7 signaling.},

Methods T1D children (n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;260, median age at diagnosis 9.4, range 0.9--14.7 years) were tested for GAD65, IA-2, ZnT8R, ZnT8W and ZnT8Q autoantibodies (A) at diagnosis, and 3--6 years after diagnosis when also fasting and stimulated RBF were determined. Results For every 1-year increase in age at diagnosis of TID, the odds of detectable C-peptide increased 1.21 (1.09, 1.34) times for fasting C-peptide and 1.28 (1.15, 1.42) times for stimulated C-peptide. Based on a linear model for subjects with no change in IA-2A levels, the odds of detectable C-peptide were 35% higher than for subjects whose IA-2A levels decreased by half (OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;1.35 (1.09, 1.67), p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.006); similarly for ZnT8WA (OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;1.39 (1.09, 1.77), p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.008) and ZnT8QA (OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;1.55 (1.06, 2.26) p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.024). Such relationship was not detected for GADA or ZnT8RA. All OR adjusted for confounders. Conclusions Age at diagnosis with T1D was the major predictor of detectable C-peptide 3--6 years post-diagnosis. Decreases in IA-2A, and possibly ZnT8A, levels between diagnosis and post-diagnosis were associated with a reduction in RBF post-diagnosis.},

In addition to lifetime supply of exogenous insulin, whole-pancreas or islet transplantation is presently the only alternative therapy for severely ill patients. Here, we discuss the current status of the development of cell-based therapies that are based on essentially two options, i.e. replacement of islet cells by islet-like cells derived from embryonic or adult stem cells, and re-establishment of immunological tolerance to islet self-antigens through regulatory T cells and/or tolerance-promoting monocyte-derived cells. A combination of both approaches will be required to turn cell-based therapy of T1D into clinical success.},

We confirmed prior studies showing association with T1D in the MHC, most significantly near HLA-DR/DQ. In the region centromeric to the MHC, we identified a peak of association within the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 3 gene (ITPR3; formerly IP3R3). The most significant single SNP in this region was at the center of the ITPR3 peak of association (P=1.7×10−4 for the survey study). For validation, we typed an additional 761 Swedish individuals. The P value for association computed from all 1,124 individuals was 1.30×10−6 (recessive odds ratio 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7--3.9). The estimated population-attributable risk of 21.6% (95% CI 10.0%--31.0%) suggests that variation within ITPR3 reflects an important contribution to T1D in Sweden. Two-locus regression analysis supports an influence of ITPR3 variation on T1D that is distinct from that of any MHC class II gene.},

abstract = {Objectives Women with diabetes have elevated gestational risks for severe hemodynamic complications, including preeclampsia in mid- to late pregnancy. This study employed continuous, chronic radiotelemetry to compare the hemodynamic patterns in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice who were overtly diabetic or normoglycemic throughout gestation. We hypothesized that overtly diabetic, pregnant NOD mice would develop gestational hypertension and provide understanding of mechanisms in progression of this pathology. Study design Telemeter-implanted, age-matched NOD females with and without diabetes were assessed for six hemodynamic parameters (mean, systolic, diastolic, pulse pressures, heart rate and activity) prior to mating, over pregnancy and over a 72 h post-partum interval. Urinalysis, serum biochemistry and renal histopathology were also conducted. Results Pregnant, normoglycemic NOD mice had a hemodynamic profile similar to other inbred strains, despite insulitis. This pattern was characterized by an interval of pre-implantation stability, post implantation decline in arterial pressure to mid gestation, and then a rebound to pre-pregnancy baseline during later gestation. Overtly diabetic NOD mice had a blood pressure profile that was normal until mid-gestation then become mildly hypotensive (−7 mmHg, P {\&}lt; 0.05), severely bradycardic (−80 bpm, P {\&}lt; 0.01) and showed signs of acute kidney injury. Pups born to diabetic dams were viable but growth restricted, despite their mothers' failing health, which did not rebound post-partum (−10% pre-pregnancy pressure and HR, P {\&}lt; 0.05). Conclusions Pregnancy accelerates circulatory and renal pathologies in overtly diabetic NOD mice and is characterized by depressed arterial pressure from mid-gestation and birth of growth-restricted offspring.},

At birth, $\beta$ cells are immature, produce only a basal amount of insulin, and are unresponsive to glucose---but are sensitive to glucagon and arginine. $\beta$ cells of spontaneously diabetic BB rats were stimulated for the first 6 days after birth by glucose with glucagon or arginine to accelerate $\beta$ cell maturation, and possibly to induce antigen expression and tolerance. Over the first 200 days of life, only 23% of glucose and glucagon-treated BB rats, and 20% of glucose and arginine-treated BB rats developed diabetes, compared with 65% of untreated controls. This finding may explain the observation that children of mothers who have type 1 diabetes are three times less likely to develop the disease than children of fathers with type 1 diabetes. Earlier maturation of $\beta$ cells during the diabetic pregnancy may protect against diabetes in later life.},

Because in diabetes the majority of T cells activated in vivo express CD4 and the islet $\beta$ cells selectively express the HLA class II antigens needed for recognition by CD4-positive T cells, the possibility that selective damage to islet $\beta$ cells may be caused by CD4-positive cytotoxic cells was investigated. Activated T cells were cloned from a newly diagnosed diabetic patient, and many CD4 cytotoxic clones were detected. The clone with the highest cytolytic capacity lysed HLA class II compatible islet cells which had been induced by interferon $\gamma$ and tumour necrosis factor to express class II antigens. The specificity of the lysis was demonstrated by use of histoincompatible islets, other histocompatible target cells, and blocking by anti-class-II monoclonal antibodies. The results show that a CD4-positive T cell clone can lyse HLA class II matched islet cells; this process may be important in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.},

abstract = {Summary T cell defined epitopes on class II HLA molecules (epitopes distinguishable by T cells but not by antibodies) seem to be important determinants of IDDM susceptibility/resistance. Although HLA-DR4 is associated with IDDM in many populations, DR4-positive HLA haplotypes vary greatly (relative risk from {\&}gt; 10 to {\&}lt;1). This variation seems to depend on both the DQ allele and T cell defined subtypes of the DR4 allele. These IDDM associated alleles at the two loci (DQB1 and DRB1) are not correlated with each other in the healthy population, so they clearly are independent risk factors. HLA-DR2 has universally been associated with lack of IDDM, and seems to be protective. However, not all DR2 haplotypes protect, and the protection or lack of protection correlates with T cell defined subtypes of DR2. In this case, however, the DR2 subtypes do correlate with DQ alleles, so it is unclear which locus (loci) is (are) actually affecting the disease process. It may be significant that, for both DR2 and DR4, only the more protective subtypes have arginine at amino acid position 71. Other portions of the DR $\beta$ chain are clearly important, however. Although TCR $\alpha$ and $\beta$ seemed to be promising candidates for additional IDDM susceptibility genes, in fact the various TCR $\alpha$ and $\beta$ haplotypes are equal, or nearly equal, with regard to IDDM susceptibility. The importance of HLA alleles in IDDM susceptibility, and the lack of importance of TCR$\alpha$ and $\beta$ alleles, may be due to the different means by which the HLA and TCR molecules achieve antigen binding diversity: HLA molecules by multiple loci and allelic diversity, and TCR molecules by the tremendous diversity that can be generated from a single TCR allele during T cell maturation.},

It is unclear whether Foxp3 exerts its Treg lineage specification function through active modification of the chromatin landscape and establishment of new enhancers or by exploiting a pre-existing enhancer landscape. Analysis of the chromatin accessibility of Foxp3-bound enhancers in Treg and Foxp3-negative T cells showed that Foxp3 was bound overwhelmingly to preaccessible enhancers occupied by its cofactors in precursor cells or a structurally related predecessor. Furthermore, the bulk of Foxp3-bound Treg cell enhancers lacking in Foxp3− CD4+ cells became accessible upon T cell receptor activation prior to Foxp3 expression, and only a small subset associated with several functionally important genes were exclusively Treg cell specific. Thus, in a late cellular differentiation process, Foxp3 defines Treg cell functionality in an ``opportunistic'' manner by largely exploiting the preformed enhancer network instead of establishing a new enhancer landscape.},

Egr2- and Egr3-defective B and T cells had hyperactive signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) and STAT3 while antigen receptor-induced activation of transcription factor AP-1 was severely impaired. We discovered that Egr2 and/or Egr3 directly induced expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, inhibitors of STAT1 and STAT3, and also blocked the function of Batf, an AP-1 inhibitor, in B and T cells. Thus, Egr2 and Egr3 regulate B and T cell function in adaptive immune responses and homeostasis by promoting antigen receptor signaling and controlling inflammation.},

NOD mice deficient in Ctss or Ctsb were partially protected from diabetes with incidence at 33% and 28%, respectively, versus wild-type NOD (69%; p {\&}lt; 0.00001). NODs lacking cathepsin L (Ctsl−/−) are completely protected from IDDM, as originally shown by others. Ctsl, Ctss, or Ctsb heterozygous mice were able to develop IDDM, although incidence levels were significantly lower for Ctsb+/− (50%) and Ctsl+/− (55%) as compared to NODs (69%; p {\&}lt; 0.03). Ctsl−/− mice contain functional, diabetogenic T cells and an enriched Foxp3+ regulatory T cell population, and diabetes resistance was due to the presence of an expanded population of regulatory T cells. These data provide additional information about the potency of the diabetogenic T cell population in Ctsl−/− mice which were comparable in potency to wild-type NOD mice. These data illustrate the critical contribution of each of these proteases in determining IDDM in the NOD mouse and provide a useful set of models for further studies.},

abstract = {To elucidate the roles of macrophages in the pathogenesis of NOD murine diabetes, peritoneal macrophages from NOD mice were injected into young NOD mice. We used 12 to 20 week-old NOD mice of both sexes as donors, and sex-matched 2-week-old NOD mice as recipients. Cyclophosphamide (CY), 200 mg/kg, was intraperitoneally injected into the donors. Two weeks later, peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were collected from the diabetic donors. Macrophagerich fractions (MRF) were collected by adherence. Then PEC(5--8 × 106) or MRF(3--7 × 106) were transferred, intraperitoneally, to the recipients. Two weeks later, some of the recipients were killed in order to perform immunofluorescent analysis of splenocytes and to assess pancreatic histology. Mac 1 positive splenocytes were increased in PEC- and in MRF-injected recipient mice. Insulitis was seen in PEC- and MRF-injected mice, but not in controls. Some of the recipients were injected with CY, 200 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, at two weeks post cell transfer. Two weeks after CY injection, the animals were examined for the presence of diabetes. The incidences of diabetes were 67% in PEC-injected mice, 40% in the MRF-injected group, and 3% in the controls. These results suggest that peritoneal macrophages accelerate the disease process in NOD mice.},

abstract = {Summary Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with certain HLA types and the presence of islet cell-specific autoantibodies. The pathogenesis is a specific loss of pancreatic $\beta$ cells. The dissection of IDDM genes is complicated by the low recurrence rate of the disease among first-degree relatives. HLA-DQ2 and 8 are closest to IDDM with a marked synergistic effect of DQ2/8 heterozygotes. The associations with other HLA genes are often explained by linkage disequilibrium. Genetic factors on other chromosomes which influence the pathogenesis are still to be fully identified but candidates are on chromosomes 11 (insulin gene polymorphisms) and 7 (TCR gene polymorphisms). The autoreactivity against the GAD65 isoform is pronounced both before and at the clinical onset of IDDM. GAD65 autoantibodies show the highest predictive value and may represent an initiating autoantigen. Autoantibodies to numerous other $\beta$ cell autoantigens are detected at the clinical onset but may represent a secondary response and antigen spreading during a sustained autoimmune attack on the $\beta$ cells. The role of T cells in human IDDM is yet to be defined. GAD65 and other islet autoantibodies have a low positive predictive value for IDDM and further investigations are needed to clarify ways to predict IDDM in the general population.},

Despite high genetic similarity, non-obese resistant (NOR) mice do not develop diabetes. We show here that spleen cells of both NOD and NOR mice respond to the islet cell antigen glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 in IFN-$\gamma$-ELISPOT assays. Moreover, NOR-T cells induce periinsulitis in NOD SCID recipient mice. Thus, a potentially pathogenic islet cell-specific T-cell response arises in NOR and NOD mice alike; the mechanism that prevents the autoimmune progression of self-reactive T cells in NOR mice presumably acts at the level of effector function. Consistent with this hypothesis, CD4+CD25+ cell-depleted spleen cells from NOR mice mediated islet cell destruction and overt diabetes in NOD SCID mice. Therefore, islet cell-specific effector cells in NOR mice appear to be under the control of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells, confirming the importance of regulatory cells in the control of autoimmune diabetes.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS All residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, with type 1 diabetes mellitus on the prevalence date January 1, 2001, were identified with the use of an established medical records linkage system (Rochester Epidemiology Project) and defined clinical criteria. Consenting patients underwent serologic screening with endomysial antibody and tissue transglutaminase antibody testing and intestinal biopsies to confirm the diagnosis of CD. A subset of screened patients also underwent HLA class II genotyping. Quality-of-life screening (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) was completed in a subset of patients at the time of serologic screening. RESULTS Overall, 392 Olmsted County residents with type 1 diabetes on January 1, 2001, were identified. A total of 158 patients with type 1 diabetes were tested, representing 40% (158/392) of the enumerated diabetic population, and 11 had biopsy-proven CD for an estimated point prevalence of 7.0% (95% confidence interval, 3.5%-12.1%). Most CD-positive diabetic patients were asymptomatic and expressed an at-risk CD haplotype with at least one of but not both HLA DQ2 or DQ8. CONCLUSIONS Celiac disease is not rare in North American patients with type 1 diabetes, and most CD-positive diabetic patients are asymptomatic irrespective of age at screening.},

The rationally designed JAK3 inhibitor JANEX-1 exhibited potent immunomodulatory activity and delayed the onset of diabetes in the NOD mouse model of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Whereas 60% of vehicle-treated control NOD mice became diabetic by 25 weeks, the incidence of diabetes at 25 weeks was only 9% for NOD females treated with daily injections of JANEX-1 (100 mg/kg/day) from Week 10 through Week 25 (P = 0.007). Furthermore, JANEX-1 prevented the development of insulitis and diabetes in NOD-scid/scid females after adoptive transfer of splenocytes from diabetic NOD females. Chemical inhibitors such as JANEX-1 may provide the basis for effective treatment modalities against human type 1 diabetes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the immunosuppressive activity of a JAK3 inhibitor in the context of an autoimmune disease.},

abstract = {Objective The notion of combining immunomodulatory agents with the incretin exendin-4 (Ex-4) has seen considerable favor as a potential therapy for the reversal of type 1 diabetes in man. While the addition of Ex-4 provides modest improvement to the effectiveness of immunological-based monotherapies in reversing hyperglycemia in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, the mechanism of action underlying this effect remains controversial and formed the basis for this investigation. Research Design and Methods Female NOD mice with new onset diabetes received either Ex-4 (0.2 $\mu$g) or saline via daily intraperitoneal injection for 30 days. To maintain viability after diagnosis of diabetes, animals also received subcutaneous insulin pellets. When persistent hyperglycemia returned, animals were sacrificed and histological studies performed to assess beta-cell proliferation (BrdU+/insulin+; Ki67+/insulin+) and fractional insulin reactive area. Results Ex-4-treated animals experienced diabetes reversal rates no better than controls. Despite this, Ex-4-treated mice demonstrated increased fractional insulin area (P=.035) and beta-cell proliferation as evidenced by elevated BrdU (P=.0001) and Ki67 staining (P=.04) with insulin co-localization. Also noteworthy, Ex-4-treated mice had poor weight gain following diagnosis in comparison to saline-treated animals (P=.003). Conclusions Ex-4 monotherapy (0.2 $\mu$g daily--10 $\mu$g/kg per day) in NOD mice with new onset diabetes increases beta-cell proliferation and fractional insulin area. Ex-4 remains a promising component of combination therapies for type 1 diabetes. Additional studies are needed to identify a dose that maximizes beta-cell proliferation and minimizes potential side effects.},

Endothelial NO bioactivity in the aorta was reduced in diabetic NOD mice while vascular expression of ECE-1 and ECE-2 mRNA was increased compared with controls (all p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05). Vascular histology was normal in all animals. Unexpectedly, treatment of prediabetic NOD mice for 6 weeks with the orally active ETA receptor antagonist BSF461314 prevented onset of diabetes without affecting insulitis severity. ETA receptor blockade also restored abnormal endothelial NO bioactivity and reduced ECE-1 and ECE-2 gene expression in NOD mice to levels comparable with healthy controls (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05). Moreover, secretion of endothelin-1 in a time-dependent fashion was observed by pancreatic islet $\beta$-cells cultured in vitro. These data suggest a critical role for ETA receptor signaling in the development of autoimmune forms of diabetes and the early vascular injury associated with it.},

abstract = {Peripheral immunological tolerance is traditionally explained by mechanisms for deletion or inactivation of autoreactive T cell clones. Using an autoimmune disease model combining transgenic mice expressing a well-defined antigen, influenza hemagglutinin (HA), on islet $\beta$ cells (Ins-HA), and a T cell receptor transgene (TCR-HNT) specific for a class II-restricted HA peptide, we demonstrate that the conventional assumptions do not apply to this in vivo situation. Double transgenic mice displayed either resistance or susceptibility to spontaneous autoimmune disease, depending on genetic contributions from either of two common Inbred mouse strains, BALB/c or B10.D2. Functional studies on autoreactive CD4+ T cells from resistant mice showed that, contrary to expectations, neither clonal energy clonal deletion, nor receptor desensitization was Induced; rather, there was a non-MHC-encoded predisposition toward differentiation to a nonpathogenic effector (Th2 versus Thl) phenotype. T cells from resistant double transgenic mice showed evidence for prior activation by antigen, suggesting that disease may be actively suppressed by autoreactive Th2 cells. These findings shed light on functional aspects of genetically determined susceptibility to autoimmunity, and should lead to new therapeutic approaches aimed at controlling the differentiation of autoreactive CD4+ effector T cells In vivo.},

These Ts are allospecific and exhibit their function interacting directly with priming APC which they render tolerogenic. Tolerogenicity of professional and non-professional human APC, such as dendritic cells and endothelial cells, respectively is due to the upregulation of the inhibitory receptors ILT3 and ILT4. ILT3 signals both intracellularly, inhibiting NF-$\kappa$B activation, and transcription of costimulatory molecules, and extracellularly, inducing anergy and regulatory function in T cells with cognate specificity. Both membrane and soluble ILT3 are proteins with potent immunosuppressive activity which are of importance for treatment of rejection, autoimmunity and cancer.},

We hypothesize that M$\Phi$s, DCs and lymphocytes have a role in pancreas and islet development because immune cells (particularly M$\Phi$s) are known to participate in the morphogenesis of various organs. In addition, we hypothesize that a defective function of immune cells generates an aberrant islet morphogenesis in T1D-prone individuals or animals. In the post-weaning period (a period of islet remodelling), the same defective function of immune cells might precipitate the pro-inflammatory peri-islet microenvironment that favours islet autoimmune reactivity.},

Despite extensive genomic identity with NOD ({\&}gt;{\&}{\#}xa0;70%), ALR mice display strong resistance to autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) due to both an unusual elevation in systemic antioxidant defenses and a reduction in cellular ROS production that extends to the beta cell level. Reciprocal backcross to NOD previously linked the ALR-derived T1D resistance to Chr. 3, 8, and 17 as well as to the ALR mt-Nd2a allele encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). To determine whether any of the ALR-derived loci protecting against T1D also protected against ALD, 296 six-week-old F2 mice from reciprocal outcrosses were alloxan-treated and assessed for diabetes onset, and a genome-wide scan (GWS) was conducted. GWS linked mt-Nd2 as well as three nuclear loci with alloxan-induced diabetes. A dominant ALR-derived ALD resistance locus on Chr. 8 colocalized with the ALR-derived T1D resistance locus identified in the previous backcross analysis. In contrast, whereas ALR contributed a novel T1D resistance locus on Chr. 3 marked by Susp, a more proximal ALR-derived region marked by Il-2 contributed ALD susceptibility, not resistance. In addition, a locus was mapped on Chr. 2, where heterozygosity provided heightened susceptibility. Tests for alloxan sensitivity in ALR conplastic mice encoding the NOD mt-Nd2c allele and NOD mice congenic for the protective Chr. 8 locus supported our mapping results. Alloxan sensitivity was increased in ALR.mtNOD mice, whereas it was decreased by congenic introduction of ALR genome on Chr. 8 into NOD. These data demonstrate both similarities and differences in the genetic control of T1D versus ROS-induced diabetes.},

Since this model was proposed, considerable research has been completed. The purpose of this article is to update the model on childhood adaptation to T1D using research conducted since the original model was proposed. The framework suggests that, in individuals and families, characteristics such as age and socioeconomic status as well as the individuals' and families' responses (self-management, coping, self-efficacy, family functioning, social competence) influence the level of adaptation; in children with T1D, characteristics such as treatment modality (pump vs injections) and psychosocial responses (depressive symptoms and anxiety) also influence the level of adaptation. Adaptation has both physiologic (metabolic control) and psychosocial (Quality of Life [QOL]) components. This revised model provides greater specificity to the factors that influence adaptation to chronic illness in children. Research and clinical implications are discussed.},

One function of Lyp is downregulation of T-cell signaling through its interaction with the negative regulatory kinase C-terminal Src tyrosine kinase (Csk). A single nucleotide polymorphism in the PTPN22 gene, C1858T, encodes products with different Csk binding affinities. Disease association of the PTPN22 1858T allele has been reported in case-control studies of three different autoimmune disorders: type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In this study, a set of 341 white, multiplex T1D families were genotyped for the C1858T single nucleotide polymorphism of PTPN22, and transmission disequilibrium test analysis revealed significant association (p = 0.005) of the T allele with T1D. No effects of parent of origin, sex of patient, or human leukocyte antigen genotype (high-risk human leukocyte antigen DR3/DR4 vs non-DR3/DR4) were observed. However, transmission of the T allele was significantly increased in the subset of patients who also carried at least one copy of the TCF7 883A allele, another allele that is important in regulating T-cell responses and that is associated with T1D. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that individuals lacking the C allele of PTPN22 may have reduced capacity to downregulate T-cell responses and may therefore be more susceptible to autoimmunity.},

Diabetes in the NOD mouse is a spontaneous tissue-specific autoimmune disease occurring without prior immunization. Therefore, it has been suggested that the anti-hs- cells involved in the autoimmune diabetes of NOD mice might reflect molecular mimicry between MT-hsp60 and a $\beta$-cell tissue specific molecule sharing similar T cell epitopes, the p277 peptide of hsp60 in particular. We cloned and expressed the mouse hsp60 cDNA from a $\beta$-cell tumour. This mouse $\beta$-cell hsp60 cDNA was found to be identical in sequence to the hsp60 of mouse fibroblasts. We further report that NOD spleen cells and an NOD diabetogenic T cell clone C9 responded to the recombinant mouse hsp60 and to its peptide M-p277 to the same extent as to H-hsp60 and H-p277. Splenocytes of mice of other strains did not respond to p277. Moreover, treatment of 3 month old NOD mice with the non-modified self M-p277 peptide was as efficient as H-p277, from which it differs in one amino acid, in halting progression of the disease. Thus, anti-H-p277 T cells modulating diabetes in the NOD mouse are autoreactive, and are targeted at the mouse $\beta$-cell hsp60, which is not tissue specific. These findings raise the question of how a non-tissue specific molecule may be a target of a tissue-specific autoimmune disease.},

In the first stage, leukocytes infiltrate the pancreatic islets in a response that does not cause damage. In the second phase, which occurs only in diabetes-prone individuals and strains, autoreactive T cells acquire aggressive potential and destroy the majority of the pancreatic islets. Rodents and humans exhibit a physiological ripple of apoptotic $\beta$-cell death shortly after birth, which induces an adaptive autoimmune response towards islet-antigens, both in diabetes-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and in mice that do not develop diabetes. Here, we propose that the early T cell-mediated autoimmune response towards islet-antigens is physiological, purposeful and beneficial.},

A possible target antigen was suggested by the proliferation of CD4 T cells from a newly diagnosed patient in response to a 38 kD polypeptide of the insulin-secretory-granule membrane. To see whether this reactivity is widespread at disease onset, we have generated T-cell lines in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of nineteen children of caucasoid origin with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and sixteen healthy controls matched for age and HLA antigens. The procedure involved two cycles of incubation with a rat beta-cell tumour subcellular fraction enriched in secretory granules and plasma membrane components, followed by a proliferation assay. Fourteen (74% [95% confidence interval 49-91%]) of the patients' cell lines showed a positive proliferative response on subsequent exposure to the islet-cell antigen preparation compared with only two (13% [2-38%]) of the controls (p=3 × 10-4; difference 61% [44-87%]). Two subjects who had high titres of islet-cell autoantibodies (ICA) without clinical diabetes produced responsive T-cell lines. Reactivity towards the 38 kD fraction of insulin-secretory-granule membranes was found only in patients (eight of ten responders tested; 95% Cl 44-98%) and one ICA-positive non-diabetic subject. Detection of an ongoing autoimmune T-cell response might be useful diagnostically and could lead to prevention of diabetes through specific immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice develop T cell-dependent autoimmune disease. Administration of interleukin-4 (IL-4), one of the T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines, is reported to prevent either insulitis or diabetes or both in NOD mice. We examined the effect of transferring an IL-4-expressing plasmid vector into muscle by in vivo electroporation on the progression of diabetes in NOD mice. Plasmid DNA expressing murine IL-4 (pCAGGS-IL-4) was introduced into the muscles of 4- and 6-week-old female NOD mice using an in vivo electroporation technique we developed previously. The serum IL-4 levels reached 2000--8000{\&}{\#}xa0;pg/ml 3 days after the delivery of pCAGGS-IL-4 and remained detectable ({\&}gt;5{\&}{\#}xa0;pg/ml) for over 4 weeks. In contrast to the previous reports, 88% of the mice treated with pCAGGS-IL-4 developed overt diabetes by 30 weeks of age, while only 25% of nontreated mice and 19% of the mice treated with control pCAGGS developed overt diabetes by then (p{\&}lt;0.01). Therefore, highly expressed IL-4 introduced by in vivo electroporation may have caused a Th1 shift, resulting in the promotion of diabetes in NOD mice. The high serum concentration of cytokines attained by our method is likely to unveil previously unknown cytokine functions.},

In T1D, these interactions somehow trigger a loss of tolerance to pancreatic $\beta$ cells, manifested in the form of a chronic autoimmune response that mobilizes virtually every cell type of the immune system and progressively erodes the host's $\beta$ cell mass. The five accompanying review articles focus on key areas of T1D research, ranging from genetics and pathogenesis to prediction and therapy. Here, I attempt to integrate and bring into focus the most salient points of these reviews in the context of other findings, with an emphasis on identifying knowledge gaps and research opportunities.},

The C3.5 clone was CD4+, V$\beta$8.3 TCR+, I--Ag7restricted and of the Th1 type. The injection of this clone into prediabetic NOD mice prevented the adoptive transfer of the disease and suppressed the development of spontaneous diabetes. This effect was reflected in a reduction in the degree and severity of insulitis in mice injected with this clone. In addition, an antibody response was elicited to the C3.5 clone in mice given multiple injections of the clone. The epitope recognized by C3.5 is located in the N-terminus of the hsp60 AA 437--460 peptide, and this clone was unable to recognize the native hsp60 molecule. These data raise questions concerning the mechanism by which peptide-based therapies prevent autoimmune disease.},

It is well known that immunotherapy with Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) is effective in preventing from the onset of autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. In the present study, we investigated whether CFA treatment restrained Th17 development and down-regulated Th17-related cytokine production in NOD mice. Th17-related cytokines (i.e. IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, IL-6, TGF-$\beta$) production in splenocytes was decreased dramatically on day 18 following CFA immunization. This effect was also observed at 10 and 20 week after adjuvant treatment. Injection of IL-17 into CFA-treated diabetes-free mice led to occurrence of overt diabetes, indicating that therapeutic effects of adjuvant treatment may be partially due to suppressing Th17 commitment. Interestingly, the main producer of IL-17 resided in a population of myeloid cells, which negatively expressed makers of neutrophil or macrophages. IL-23 stimulation did not alter the distribution of IL-17 in myeloid cells. Furthermore, this pattern of IL-17 expression was also present in Balb/c and C57BL/6 strains. These findings may have important implications for understanding of mechanisms underlying adjuvant treatment on autoimmune diseases.},

Defective dentate gyrus (DG) neurogenesis is associated with affective-related disorders and depression. We previously demonstrated reduced DG neurogenesis in a pharmacological type 1 diabetes model, the streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mouse. Here, we explored DG neurogenesis in a spontaneous T1D model, the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, at prediabetic and diabetic stages. Cell proliferation was assessed in the DG of 5, 8 and 12-week-old control C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains and NOD mice, killed 2 h after bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) administration. Survival of the newly generated cells was studied in 15-week-old animals that were killed 21 days after BrdU injection. The number of proliferative BrdU-positive cells in the DG was, regardless of age, constantly and significantly lower in NOD than in control strains, showing the presence of hippocampal alterations far before clinical diabetes onset in NOD mice. Diabetes also strongly decreased cell survival in NOD DG. However, cell phenotype proportion, as assessed by co-localization with neuronal or glial markers and confocal microscopy, was not modified. Hippocampal neurogenesis is strongly diminished in the spontaneous NOD model, like in the STZ model. Notably, NOD hippocampal DG cell proliferation defect takes place during the prediabetic stage. Whether this early alteration might result, in this autoimmune strain, from hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis alterations and/or ongoing brain inflammatory process sharing many characteristics of aging is discussed and deserves further investigation.},

abstract = {Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), or type 1 diabetes, is the outcome of a progressive and selective destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Although evidence of T-cell involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease is incontrovertibly offered by histologic analyses of the pancreata from children at the onset of the disease and confirmed in animal models of the disease such as the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse or the BioBreeding rat, the mechanisms that allow or trigger this immunologic invasion of the islets of the pancreas still elude complete understanding. The genetic component of the disease is well-documented, and the linkage with certain alleles at different HLA class II loci has been proven beyond statistical doubt.20 In some large family studies, other loci were found to be weakly associated with the disease, but these results were not confirmed by additional studies on other family groups.16,20 When strict statistical parameters were used to assess the significance of the likelihood ratio between markers and diabetes, even the 5′ region of the insulin gene, the IDDM2 genetic region, was proven to be ``associated'' but very weakly ``linked'' with the disease.16 Even in the HLA gene complex (i.e., the IDDM1 genetic region), what is actually genetically transmitted is not the disease itself, but the propensity or the susceptibility to the disease.78 Despite the finding that the majority of diabetic individuals share the HLA-DQA1*0301, DQB1*0302 or DQA1*0501, DQB1*0201 haplotypes, whereas siblings in the same families seem to be protected from the disease by carrying the DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602 haplotype, in the general population, many individuals with susceptibility haplotypes do not present with any sign of the disease. The conclusion of geneticists is that the susceptibility attributable to the genetic component of the disease, even when considering genetic segments with weak statistical associations, constitutes less than 50%.20 This conclusion is strongly supported by the fact that concordance for the disease in monozygotic twins does not reach 50%.10 The involvement of a nongenetic component of the disease must be considered. This component can only be offered by the environment. Many different environmental triggers have been considered during the last 20 years of disease-related studies. They vary from proteins present in cow's milk, frequently used to complement breast-feeding,40 to viral agents to which children can be frequently exposed before or after their immune system has completely developed.64 The genetic HLA linkage and the immunopathologic T-cell presence in the damaged islets, the documented presence of antibodies directed against normal structures of the islet cells in the serum of diabetic patients,63 the efficient although temporary effect of immunosuppression in delaying the onset of the disease,7,9 and the evidence that IDDM can be transferred from a diabetic donor to a nondiabetic recipient via bone marrow transplantation45 strongly indicate the potential autoimmune nature of the pathologic mechanism causing the disease.8 Autoimmunity defines a breakdown of self-tolerance whereby immunocompetent cells begin to attack tissues or cells of their own body (i.e., self). An important component of the immune mechanism that leads to overt diabetes and that needs to be studied further are self-tissue determinants, the so-called autoantigens. Another critical component is the triggering of foreign (i.e., nonself) antigens provided by the environment. Understanding the complex interplay existing between the genetic and the immunologic components of the disease in relationship to autoantigens and foreign antigens is the conditio sine qua non for proposing valuable prevention strategies against diabetes and eventually for implementing reliable and safe intervention approaches.},

Association of PstI-8.5 kb allele of HSP70 gene with Type 1 diabetes was previously reported in the Caucasian population. Since HSP70 gene is located in the class III region of HLA, the association may be due to the linkage disequilibrium between class II HLA and HSP70 genes. To study whether HSP70 gene is associated with Type 1 diabetes independent of class II HLA genes, we analyzed both HSP70 gene and class II HLA genes in 32 Japanese patients with Type 1 diabetes and 31 control subjects. By Southern blot hybridization with restriction enzyme PstI and HSP70 genomic probe, two allelic bands, 9.0 kb and 8.5 kb, were detected as reported in the Caucasian population. The allele frequencies of 8.5 kb in Type 1 diabetic patients and normal controls were 0.39 and 0.44, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups. On the other hand, by PCR-RFLP analysis, DQA1∗0301, DQB1∗0303 and DQB1∗0401 alleles were positively associated with Type 1 diabetes and DQA1∗01 was negatively associated with Type 1 diabetes. These data suggest that the polymorphism of HSP70 gene was not associated with Type 1 diabetes in the Japanese population, and that association of PstI-8.5 kb allele with Type 1 diabetes observed in Caucasian population appears to be due to the linkage disequilibrium between this allele and HLA-DR3.},

The reduction in CD4 cell percentage was associated with a reduction in the number of cells in the thymus and spleen following the injection. CD4+ cells which survived the injections were nevertheless able to enter cell cycle when stimulated by Con A. None of the CD4-treated NOD mice became diabetic by 6 months of age and none of the animals studied histologically at this time had insulitis. At 9 months of age (three months after stopping the CD4 injections) the mice made antibody to human IgG. At 1 year of age most of the male mice had insulitis, although none of the male or female mice had become spontaneously diabetic. Two thirds of animals injected with cyclophosphamide at 16 months became diabetic within 3 weeks. The results confirm that treatment with CD4 antibody in the first 6 months suffices to reduce the incidence of diabetes in NOD mice. The treatment does not prevent the subsequent development of insulitis in injected mice and does not prevent the accumulation of cells capable of causing overt diabetes after cyclophosphamide injection.},

These data indicate that immunopotentiators could modulate the autoimmune mechanisms directed to pancreatic islets and inhibit the development of diabetes in BB rats.},

abstract = {Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice show profound pathomorphological changes in sympathetic ganglia during the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus. We tested the hypothesis that NOD mice represent an experimental model to investigate cardiovascular changes seen in humans with diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Blood glucose (BG) levels were measured once a week. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed as BG levels exceeded 250 mg/dl twice. NOD mice that did not become diabetic served as control group. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored by telemetry and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was calculated with the sequence method or with cross spectral analysis. The measurements were obtained before onset of diabetes and during the 4th week of diabetes. The onset of diabetes was accompanied by a continuous decline in HR (615{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;14 vs. 498{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;23 bpm), whereas BP values remained stable (108{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;2 vs. 111{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;2 mm Hg). The circadian HR rhythm increased in diabetic NOD mice. BRS was higher in diabetic NOD mice than in controls. Atropine reduced BRS more profoundly in diabetic mice compared to non-diabetic mice. Despite pathomorphological similarities of the diabetic autonomic neuropathy between patients with diabetes and diabetic NOD mice, the changes in blood pressure regulation are different. In conclusion the use of diabetic NOD mice as a functional model for human diabetes may be questioned.},

Frozen pancreas samples were obtained from 45 cadaveric T1D donors with disease durations ranging from 1 wk to >50 yr, 14 nondiabetic controls, 5 nondiabetics with islet autoantibodies, 2 cases of gestational diabetes, and 6 T2D patients. Sections were systematically analyzed for the presence of insulin-sufficient $\beta$ cells, CD8(+) insulitic lesions, and HLA class I hyperexpression. Finally, consecutive sections from HLA-A2-expressing individuals were probed for CD8 T cell reactivity against six defined islet autoantigens associated with T1D by in situ tetramer staining. Both single and multiple CD8 T cell autoreactivities were detected within individual islets in a subset of patients up to 8 yr after clinical diagnosis. Pathological features such as HLA class I hyperexpression and insulitis were specific for T1D and persisted in a small portion of the patients with longstanding disease. Insulitic lesions consistently presented in a multifocal pattern with varying degrees of infiltration and $\beta$ cell loss across affected organs. Our observations provide the first direct proof for islet autoreactivity within human islets and underscore the heterogeneous and chronic disease course.},

abstract = {Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is considered to be an autoimmune disorder characterized by destruction of the pancreatic $\beta$-cells by auto-reacting lymphocytes. An attractive therapeutic approach to this disease would be to abrogate the autoimmune process at an early stage, thus preserving a critical mass of pancreatic $\beta$-cells necessary for maintenance of normal glucose tolerance. Linomide (quinoline-3-carboxamide, Roquinimex, LS 2616), is a novel, orally absorbed, immunomodulatory drug that has been shown to be effective in various models of autoimmunity without causing non-specific immunosuppression. In this review, we describe the efficacy of Linomide for ameliorating the autoimmune process and diabetes in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) model of IDDM when administered at early stages of the disease. We also show that advanced disease in the NOD mouse can be treated effectively by combining Linomide with therapeutic modalities designed to increase pancreatic $\beta$-cell mass. Subsequent clinical studies have shown that Linomide preserves $\beta$-cell function in individuals with new-onset IDDM. Based on these data, Linomide or derivatives thereof might be useful for treatment of human IDDM.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the mouse is associated with increased responsivity to innate immune challenge. Here we demonstrate that in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes (T1D) LPS-dependent suppression of social exploration (SE) is augmented and dependent on hyperglycemia. T1D was induced in mice with intraperitoneal (i.p.) streptozotocin (STZ). After 4{\&}{\#}xa0;d, STZ treated mice had blood glucose levels of 417{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;34{\&}{\#}xa0;mg/dl compared to 160{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;11{\&}{\#}xa0;mg/dl in non-STZ treated mice. When these diabetic mice were challenged with i.p. lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-induced depression of SE was nearly 2.7-fold greater in diabetic mice at 2{\&}{\#}xa0;h than in non-diabetic mice. Examination of peritoneal proinflammatory cytokine levels 2{\&}{\#}xa0;h after LPS administration showed that diabetic mice had 4-, 2.5- and 3.6-fold greater concentrations of IL-1$\beta$, IL-6 and TNF-$\alpha$, respectively, when compared to non-diabetic mice. Control of blood glucose levels with injected insulin in diabetic mice improved 2{\&}{\#}xa0;h post LPS-induced loss of SE by 3.9-fold. Interestingly, insulin given intracerebroventricularly to diabetic mice did not impact LPS-induced loss of SE but did increase basal SE 8, 12 and 24{\&}{\#}xa0;h later. Finally, administration of STZ to hyperglycemic/hyperinsulinemic db/db mice did not alter LPS-induced loss of SE. Taken together these findings indicate that mice with T1D have augmented loss of SE in response to LPS and this is due to hyperglycemia and not to insulin.},

However, the myelotoxic agents currently required to establish chimerism have prevented the translation of this approach to the clinic. Here, we investigated whether multimodal costimulatory blockade would enhance chimerism and promote islet allograft tolerance in spontaneously diabetic nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Materials and Methods Prediabetic and spontaneously diabetic NOD mice were preconditioned with anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody before conditioning with 500 cGy total body irradiation and transplantation with 30 × 106 B10.BR bone marrow cells. Overtly diabetic animals were conditioned similarly and transplanted with 300 to 400 B10.BR islets. After irradiation, both groups of recipients were treated with anti-CD154, anti-OX40L, and anti-inducible T-cell costimulatory monoclonal antibodies. Urine, blood glucose levels, and chimerism were monitored. Results Conditioning of NOD mice with costimulatory blockade significantly enhanced engraftment, with 61% of mice engrafting at 1 month. Eleven of 12 chimeric animals with engraftment at 1 month remained diabetes-free over a 12-month follow-up, whereas nonchimeric animals progressed to diabetes. In contrast, similar conditioning prolonged islet allograft survival in only 2 of 11 overtly diabetic NOD recipients. Chimerism levels in the 9 islet rejector animals were 0%. Conclusions Although nonmyeloablative conditioning reversed the autoimmune process in prediabetic NOD mice, the same regimen was significantly less effective in establishing chimerism and reversing autoimmune diabetes in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice.},

abstract = {The interrelationship between human leukocyte antigen immunogenetics and environmental factors and their contribution to the emergence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) were studied in Jewish immigrants from Ethiopia in Israel. This community displays high incidence of T1D, and is unique both by its ethnic segregation and its rapid exposure to a new environment after the immigration. The study population consisted of 152 Ethiopian Jews living in Israel, 33 with T1D and 119 unrelated controls. Human leukocyte antigen class II susceptible and protective alleles in the Jewish Ethiopian patients were similar to those in patients of other ethnic groups in Israel and in non-Jewish Ethiopian patients, with a few exceptions. Three haplotypes were markedly associated with diabetes in Jewish Ethiopian patients: DRB1*0301 DQA1*05 DQB1*02 (OR 4.4, p {\&}lt; 0.001); DRB1*0404 DQA1 03 DQB1*0302 (OR 19.2, p = 0.006), and DRB1*0405 DQA1*03 DQB1*0302 (OR 87.8, p {\&}lt; 0.001). The highly susceptible allele DRB1*0301 was more common in the general Ethiopian population (25.2%) than in all other ethnic groups in Israel, which may render this community prone to the disease. The age at onset of disease in patients with two susceptible haplotypes was negatively correlated with the duration of living in Israel (r = −0.621, p = 0.04). We concluded that ongoing exposure of genetically predisposed immigrants from Ethiopia to diabetogenic environmental factors eventually leads to a high incidence of overt diabetes in this ethnic group.},

A congenic strain of NOD mice bearing I-Akon a NOD background (NOD-H2h4) has recently been derived and displays a much greater tendency to develop thyroiditis and autoantibodies to mouse thyroglobulin (MTg) although it is free of diabetes. Both thyroid infiltrates and autoantibody formation are accelerated and enhanced in NOD-H2h4mice by increased iodine intake. The effect of increased iodine intake on NOD mice themselves has not been directly investigated although a recent study of these animals given high or low doses of iodine showed no follicular destruction unless the mice were first rendered goitrous by iodine deprivation. We found that dietary iodine increased both the incidence and the severity of thyroid lesions in our NOD mice although autoantibodies to MTg were absent. NOD background genes appear to be essential for the development of these lesions, which were maximal after 4 weeks of iodine administration and showed no significant regression when the iodine was stopped. Furthermore, our studies show for the first time that both CD4+and CD8+T cells are necessary for the development of this accelerated but essentially spontaneous murine thyroid disease.},

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that is associated with the HLA region of the genome, with HLA class II genes conferring the greatest statistical risk. The presentation of self-peptides by HLA class I molecules is defective in individuals with this disease, and both TAP1 and TAP2 are potential contributors to this defect. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was applied to screen all 11 exons and the 3′ flanking region of TAP2 for polymorphisms in individuals with type 1 diabetes patients and controls. Seventy polymorphisms, including 51 in introns, 4 in the 3′ flanking region, and 15 in exons, were identified. Sequencing of polymorphic DNA fragments revealed several new polymorphisms, including a Gln → Arg substitution at codon 611 and a GT → GC polymorphism affecting the donor splice site of intron 4, that might be of functional significance. None of the polymorphisms examined differed in frequency between individuals with type 1 diabetes and controls.},

abstract = {Troglitazone has recently been introduced in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. In addition to its anti-diabetic effects it acts as a perixosome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-$\gamma$) agonist and has anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting macrophage tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) secretion. It also inhibits the production of endothelial selectin (e-selectin). Troglitazone also reduces interleukin-1$\alpha$ induced nitric oxide production in pancreatic beta-cells, which may be relevant in preventing nitric oxide mediated damage to these cells in the Type 1 diabetes process. We tested troglitazone in the spontaneous model of autoimmune diabetes, the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, to determine its effect on the disease process. When administered by gavage from weaning at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight (n=32), troglitazone reduced the incidence of diabetes by 16 weeks compared to controls (n=32) in a pattern that was maintained up to the conclusion of the experiment at 31 weeks of age (p{\&}lt;0.05). Insulitis was unaltered (index=1.05$\pm$0.71 vs. 1.13$\pm$0.82, treated vs. controls, p=0.78). The study was repeated using troglitazone in the diet of NOD mice (n=24) to give a dose of approximately 200 mg/kg body weight in order to provide a more consistent level of troglitazone during the time course of the experiment. There was a reduction of diabetes incidence in this group but it did not reach significance. Insulin levels were reduced in gavage treated mice although such reduction did not reach significance (p{\&}lt;0.07). We conclude that, in view of its effect on this model of autoimmune diabetes and because of its known function as an insulin sensitiser, troglitazone might be considered for potential use in those patients with Type 1 masquerading as Type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Objective To analyze the age at menarche of girls with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who were diagnosed with the disease before puberty and compare it with that of an age-matched group of normal girls. Previous studies on the appearance of menarche showed that the mean age of onset of menarche is delayed in girls affected by T1D compared with normal girls. Design Case-control study. Setting Patients and controls in an academic research environment. Patient(s) We studied, retrospectively, the charts of 162 consecutive girls with T1D born in a geographically defined region between 1984 and 1994 with a mean disease duration of 3--5 years, all of whom were on intensive insulin therapy since diagnosis of T1D. The control group consisted of 214 normal girls born between 1984 and 1994, who agreed to fill in an anonymous questionnaire regarding age at menarche and other clinical information. Intervention(s) There was no intervention per se in the study. Age at menarche appears as a dependent variable of body mass index (BMI), HbA1c, and so on. Main Outcome Measure(s) BMI, HbA1c, and duration of T1D at menarche were considered among the potential factors affecting the age of menarche. Result(s) Age at menarche in girls with T1D was significantly delayed compared with control girls (12.6 $\pm$ 1.5 years vs. 12.25 $\pm$ 1.4 years, respectively). HbA1c levels and BMI did not influence the age at menarche. Conclusion(s) Despite intensive insulin therapy and good metabolic control since diagnosis of T1D, the age at menarche is still delayed in girls who develop T1D before puberty.},

abstract = {Recent studies in NOD mice suggest that cellular and humoral responses against $\beta$ cell protein(s) cross-reactive with mycobacterial heat-shock protein, hsp60, are implicated in the development of autoimmune diabetes. However, this putative, hsp60-related autoantigen has not yet been identified nor have the preceding events triggering the autoimmunity against it. Our recent studies show that antibodies to the mammalian hsp60 bind specifically to the 62 kDa protein located to insulin secretory granules and mitochondria of pancreatic $\beta$ cells of healthy mice [1]. In islets of prediabetic NOD mice affected by insulitis, the cellular distribution of this hsp60-related antigen was found to be altered. In the present report, we have examined whether this endogenous hsp60-related protein of secretory granules serves as an autoantigen in type I diabetes. The results of Western blot analysis indicate that diabetic mice sera show reactivity to a 62 kDa islet cell antigen. The NOD mice sera that were positive in detection of the 62 kDa islet cell antigen were also able to recognize the recombinant human hsp60. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that diabetic NOD mouse sera, cross-reactive to human recombinant hsp60, recognize the antigen located in secretory granules of $\beta$ cells. Double-immunogold labelling demonstrated that antigens recognized by both diabetic NOD mice sera and monoclonal hsp60 antibodies co-localized in the same secretory granules of $\beta$ cells. Preincubation of islet cell sections with one type of antibody blocks subsequent binding of the other, indicating that epitopes recognized by both antisera on these proteins are shared. Moreover, preadsorption of diabetic sera with the recombinant human hsp60 abolished labelling of secretory granules. These results indicate that the hsp60-related protein of $\beta$ cell secretory granules is an autoantigen in type I diabetes in NOD mice.},

abstract = {Pancreatic-islet transplantation is currently regarded as the only approach to cure type 1 diabetic patients (T1D). However, recurrent autoimmunity is a critical factor contributing to graft rejection along with alloreactivity. Recently, the glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) was identified as the one of the major pancreatic antigens targeted by self-reactive T cells in T1D. Therefore, the T cells specific for GAD65 may be the important therapeutical target of T1D. In this study, dendritic cells (DCs) were transfected with the recombinant adenovirus, dual expressing DcR3 and GAD65 in vitro, and NOD mice were adminstrated with the genetically modified DCs in vivo after islet transplantation. The results demonstrated that the genetically modified DCs significantly supressed the T cell response to GAD65, delayed onset of diabetes, improved the success and survival of islet transplantation. The findings suggest that the adoptive transfer of genetically modified DCs dual expressing DcR3 and GAD65 represent a future therapeutic potential in T1D and pancreatic-islet transplantation.},

Less than 5% of these chimeras, however, spontaneously progress to autoimmune diabetes, an incidence far lower than observed in NOD mice. The resistance in chimeras can be accounted for by the target organ chimerism and/or the immune system chimerism. To investigate the mechanism(s) controlling diabetes resistance in these mice, we studied a total of 92 NOD{\&}lt;-{\&}gt;B6 EA chimeras that showed overt lymphoid chimerism and treated 34 chimeras with cyclophosphamide (CY), a compound known to precipitate an acute form of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in pre-diabetic NOD mice, by interfering with regulatory mechanisms. We found that CY-treated EA chimeras displayed an increase in the NOD:B6 lymphocyte ratio and 32% of them developed diabetes that could be adoptively transferred to irradiated NOD or NOD-rag-2−/−mice. These findings suggest that lymphocyte chimerism rather than $\beta$- cell chimerism accounts for diabetes resistance in NOD{\&}lt;-{\&}gt;B6 EA chimeras and that the susceptibility to CY-induced diabetes may be related to the proportion of NOD versus B6 lymphoid cells.},

abstract = {Physiologically, HLA Class II molecules are primarily expressed on immunoregulatory cells. In recent years, it has been shown that tissues affected by autoimmunity, including beta cells of `diabetic' pancreases, `inappropriately' express these glycoproteins. Cytokines are potent Class II inducers on a variety of cells but they exert a heterogenous effect when incubated with different human endocrine cells, i.e. thyroid cells are readily inducible, beta cells are much more resistant. The fine modulation of Class II expression by cytokines has been extensively studied and recent information on their action on endocrine cells is reported here. The possibility that distinct environmental factors from those postulated until now may be responsible for triggering the inappropriate expression of MHC molecules in epithelial cells in vivo is also emphasized. Despite several similarities between human Type I diabetes and spontaneous animal models of the disease, major differences still exist. Transgenic models have now been produced. However, even if they offer interesting new insights, they have not so far provided the decisive answer to explain the pathogenesis of human autoimmune diseases.},

In this study we have analyzed the prevalence of glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65)- and proinsulin-specific CD4+ T-cells in type 1 diabetes patients, at-risk subjects and in HLA-matched control children. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured in the presence of two different GAD65 peptides (555--567, 557I and 274--286) or with a proinsulin (B24--C36) peptide for 10--11{\&}{\#}xa0;days.

Our results show that 11 of 18 (61%) type 1 diabetes patients and 7 of the 20 (35%) at-risk subjects were positive for one of the three GAD65 or proinsulin-containing tetramers, whereas only 2 of 21 (9.5%) controls had tetramer binding cells (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.0007 type 1 diabetes vs. controls and p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.0488 at-risk subjects vs. controls, Chi-square test). Type 1 diabetes patients responded to all three peptides. At-risk subjects recognized also the GAD65 555--567 557I peptide, while none of the controls responded to it. In conclusion, type 1 diabetes patients and at-risk subjects have a significantly higher prevalence of GAD65- and proinsulin-specific CD4+ T-cells than the control subjects.},

abstract = {Diabetes-prone NOD mice of both sexes and at different ages were compared to control mice with regard to the level of pancreatic expression of certain autoantigens: antigens for islet cell antibodies (ICA antigens) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 67 kDa. ICA antigens were compared by immunofluorescence using serial dilutions of ICA positive human sera so that differences of fluorescence intensity were due only to differences in amounts of antigen. Pancreatic GAD67 mRNAs were compared by polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern hybridization with 32P-probes and densitometry of autoradiographic bands. GAD67 product and $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were compared by immunoperoxydase staining. As compared to BALB/c, CS7BL6, Swiss, or F1 mice, NOD mice displayed higher ICA antigen levels (P{\&}lt;0.01) both before and after insulitis onset (at 7 days, 15 days, 1 month, 2 months). ICA antigens were scarcely detectable by the first day of life, and increased with age from 7 days to 2 months (P{\&}lt;0.01; n=10 for each strain and at each age). Both before and after insulitis onset (4 days, 7 days, 15 days, 1 month, 2 months), amounts of GAD67 mRNAs were higher (P{\&}lt;0.01) in NOD mice than in BALB/c mice (n=8 for each age in each strain). This was already noted in foetuses on Day 18 of gestation (n=8). After birth, amounts of GAD67 mRNAs increased up to 1 month (P{\&}lt;0.04) and then decreased in older mice. The staining intensity of pancreatic sections with antisera against either GAD67 or GABA was higher (P{\&}lt;0.04) in islets from NOD mice than in those from control mice. Whatever the age, no significant difference was noted between female and male NOD mice with regard to ICA antigens or GAD67. The expression of ICA antigens and GAD67 was intermediate in NOD × BALB/c F1 mice when compared to parental strains. We conclude that whatever the age, NOD mice strongly express ICA antigens and GAD67. This peculiarity was detectable very early, in embryos for GAD67 but after birth for ICA antigens. The timing of antigen expression may underlie the development of diabetes. The antigen overexpression might affect early completion of self-tolerance and, during later life, might also contribute to amplification of the anti-$\beta$ cell autoimmune response due to the existence of more targets for effector mechanisms.},

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major long-term complication of both types of diabetes and retains a high human, social and economic cost. Thus, the identification of markers for the early detection of DN represents a relevant target of diabetic research. The present work is a pilot study focused on proteomic analysis of serum of controls (n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;9), IDDM patients (n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;10) and DN patients (n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;4) by the ClinProt profiling technology based on mass spectrometry. This approach allowed to identify a pattern of peptides able to differentiate the studied populations with sensitivity and specificity close to 100%. Variance of the results allowed to estimate the sample size needed to keep the expected False Discovery Rate low. Moreover, three peptides differentially expressed in the serum of patients as compared to controls were identified by LC-ESI MS/MS as the whole fibrinopeptide A peptide and two of its fragments, respectively. The two fragments were under-expressed in diabetic patients, while Fibrinopeptide A was over-expressed, suggesting that anomalous turnover of Fibrinopeptide A could be involved in the pathogenesis of DN.},

We examined whether PTPN22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) other than R620W and haplotypes are associated with T1D in the Japanese population. We compared the allele frequencies of five haplotype-tagging SNPs in the PTPN22 gene, 2 of which are reportedly associated with RA in Caucasians (rs3789604 and rs1310182), and compared haplotype distributions between 184 Japanese T1D patients and 179 healthy controls. rs3789604 was not associated with T1D in our Japanese subjects. The frequency of the C allele of rs1310182 differed significantly between T1D patients and controls. Permutation analysis revealed the distribution of this haplotype to differ significantly between T1D patients and controls. One rare haplotype that included the susceptibility allele of rs1310182 was more frequent, while another rare haplotype that included the protective allele of rs1310182 was absent, in T1D patients. This significant haplotype distribution difference suggests that polymorphisms in the PTPN22 gene other than R620W are involved in either predisposition to or protection from T1D in the Japanese population.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is mediated by destruction of pancreatic $\beta$-cells by CD4 and CD8 T cells specific for epitopes on numerous diabetogenic autoantigens resulting in loss of glucose homeostasis. Employing antigen-specific tolerance induced by i.v. administration of syngeneic splenocytes ECDI cross-linked to various diabetogenic antigens/epitopes (Ag-SP), we show that epitope spreading plays a functional role in the pathogenesis of T1D in NOD mice. Specifically, Ag-SP coupled with intact insulin, Ins B9-23 or Ins B15-23, but not GAD65509-528, GAD65524-543 or IGRP206-214, protected 4--6 week old NOD mice from the eventual development of clinical disease; infiltration of immune cells to the pancreatic islets; and blocked the induction of DTH responses in a Treg-dependent, antigen-specific manner. However, tolerance induction in 19--21 week old NOD mice was effectively accomplished only by Ins-SP, suggesting Ins B9-23 is a dominant initiating epitope, but autoimmune responses to insulin epitope(s) distinct from Ins B9-23 emerge during disease progression.},

Disturbances of oxidative burst and phagocytic activities in neutrophils of diabetic patients compared to uncontrolled disease support the importance of neutrophil functions in the treatment and follow up of diabetic patients. This study is designed in order to investigate Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiles and neutrophil functions in early clinical stage of T1D. Patients diagnosed as T1D but not yet under insulin therapy (Group 1; n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;15) and T1D patients with disease duration of {\&}lt;3 months (Group 2; n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;20) were compared to healthy subjects (Group 3; n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;15).

Intracytoplasmic interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-$\gamma$ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$ levels of isolated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and neutrophil functions were determined by flow cytometry. Intracellular TNF-$\alpha$ level of CD4+ T lymphocytes was significantly decreased in Group 1 compared to Group 2 and healthy subjects. In contrast, TNF-$\alpha$ in CD8+ T lymphocytes was higher in Group 1 compared to Group 2. Increased TNF-$\alpha$ content of CD8+ T lymphocytes was also obtained in Groups 1 and 2 compared to healthy subjects. Increased TNF-$\alpha$ secretion of CD8+ T cells might reflect the role of CD8+ T cells in $\beta$ cell destruction. Similar to cytokine content, phagocytic and oxidative burst activities in Group 1 were significantly lower compared to Group 2 and healthy subjects. Impaired neutrophil functions could be recovered by the treatment of the disease.},

We have performed a comprehensive evaluation of disease-modifying agents tested in the NOD mouse based on treatment timing, duration, study length, and efficacy. Interestingly, some popular tenets regarding NOD interventions were not confirmed: all treatments do not prevent disease, treatment dose and timing strongly influence efficacy, and several therapies have successfully treated overtly diabetic mice. The analysis provides a unique perspective on NOD interventions and suggests that the response of this model to therapeutic interventions can be a useful predictor of the human response as long as careful consideration is given to treatment dose, timing, and protocols; more thorough investigation of these parameters should improve clinical translation.},

abstract = {The cause of type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains unknown; however, a decisive role for environmental factors is recognized. The increased incidence of T1D during the last decades, as well as regional differences, is paralleled by differences in the intestinal bacterial flora. A new animal model was established to test the hypothesis that bacteria entering the pancreatic ductal system could trigger $\beta$-cell destruction and to provide new insights to the immunopathology of the disease. Obtained findings were compared with those present in two patients dying at onset of T1D. Different bacterial species, present in the human duodenum, instilled into the ductal system of the pancreas in healthy rats rapidly induced cellular infiltration, consisting of mainly neutrophil polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes/macrophages, centered around the pancreatic ducts. Also, the islets of Langerhans attracted polymorphonuclear cells, possibly via release of IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1. Small bleedings or large dilatations of the capillaries were frequently found within the islets, and several $\beta$-cells had severe hydropic degeneration (ie, swollen cytoplasm) but with preserved nuclei. A novel rat model for the initial events in T1D is presented, revealing marked similarities with the morphologic findings obtained in patients dying at onset of T1D and signifying a decisive role for bacteria in eliciting an adverse innate immunity response. The present findings support the hypothesis that T1D is an organ-specific inflammatory disease.},

Inter-individual variations in these factors probably explain the significant complexity associated with autoimmune diseases; however, quantitative issues are also important because clinical disease will manifest only if a sufficient amount of cellular material has been destroyed. Therefore, the presence of autoreactive lymphocytes does not always signify disease; rather, the kinetics of their generation, their resulting numbers and the regulation of their activation and effector functions (destructive versus regulatory) will determine the ultimate outcome and make the difference between subclinical autoimmunity and disease.},

It is unclear what these missing factors are. However, signals emanating from the T cell receptor (TCR), the costimulatory receptor CD28, and the family of $\gamma$c-dependent cytokine receptors are required for Treg cell development. Herein we demonstrate that expression of a constitutively active Stat5b transgene (Stat5b-CA) allowed for Treg cell development in neonatal mice and restored Treg cell numbers in Cd28−/− mice. Sequence analysis of TCR genes in Stat5b-CA Treg cells indicated that ectopic STAT5 activation resulted in a TCR repertoire that more closely resembled that of naive T cells. Using MHCII tetramers to identify antigen-specific T cells, we showed that STAT5 signals diverted thymocytes normally destined to become naive T cells into the Treg cell lineage. Our data support a two-step model of Treg cell differentiation in which TCR and CD28 signals induce cytokine responsiveness and STAT5-inducing cytokines then complete the program of Treg cell differentiation.},

abstract = {An individual's predisposition to Type I diabetes (T1D) is largely determined by complex interactions between several genetic loci and other, nonheritable factors. In T1D, the HLA locus has been known for decades to contribute 50% of the inherited risk. Outside the HLA are many proposed candidate loci with smaller effects, but only two confirmed candidate genes, the INS-VNTR and the CTLA-4 genes, which together do not contribute more than 15% of the risk. Because of the high frequency of the disease-associated DNA variants of these genes, understanding the biological mechanisms of such DNA variation in the context of T1D can have tremendous impact on the development of preventive therapeutics. However, establishing a causal relationship between common DNA variations and disease-predisposing functional effects is not trivial and remains difficult, as the effects are expected to be subtle. The variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) region upstream of the insulin gene is known to mediate expression in the thymus and pancreas, whereas various polymorphisms in the 5′ and 3′ regulatory regions of CTLA-4 are thought to alter gene expression and a coding A49G polymorphism exerts effects on post-translational processing. This review details the latest efforts in elucidating the functional mechanisms that explain the genetic association of the INS-VNTR and CTLA-4 genes with T1D.},

Mice received intraperitoneal treatment with saline, Prolastin (1 or 2 mg/mouse) or Aralast (2 mg/mouse) on days −1, 0, 3, 6, and 9. Saline-treated mice rejected the grafts 10.0 $\pm$ 2.5 days after transplantation (n = 9). Prolastin 1 mg (n = 9) and 2 mg (n = 3) resulted in rejection on 8.7 $\pm$ 1.4 (not significant) and 13.0 $\pm$ 4.3 days (P {\&}lt; .03), respectively. Aralast-treated mice showed prolongation of graft survival (13 $\pm$ 5.9 days; n = 5; P {\&}lt; .03). Notably, repeated administrations of either hAAT formulation led to sudden death of a proportion of treated animals. Collectively, our preliminary data indicate that prolongation of islet allograft survival in the stringent autoimmune diabetic NOD mouse model can be achieved with hAAT monotherapy. The death of a proportion of treated animals may be consequent to immunization to hAAT and lethal hypersensitivity. Interestingly, this phenomenon was not observed in a non-autoimmune mouse strain (C57BL/6) despite extended hAAT treatment ({\&}gt;100 days).},

Its ultimate consequence is $\beta$-cell insufficiency-mediated dysregulation of blood glucose control. In terms of T1D treatment, immunotherapy addresses the cause of T1D, mainly through re-setting the balance between autoimmunity and regulatory mechanisms. Regulatory T cells play an important role in this immune intervention. An alternative T1D treatment is $\beta$-cell replacement, which can reverse the consequence of the disease by replacing destroyed $\beta$-cells in the diabetic pancreas. The applicable insulin-producing cells can be directly obtained from islet transplantation or generated from other cell sources such as autologous adult stem cells, embryonic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells. In this review, we summarize the recent research progress and analyze the possible advantages and disadvantages of these two therapeutic options especially focusing on the potential synergistic effect on T1D treatment. Exploring the optimal combination of immunotherapy and $\beta$-cell replacement will pave the way to the most effective cure for this devastating disease.},

Surprisingly, despite decades of work, little is known about consistency of most clustering algorithms. In this paper we investigate consistency of the popular family of spectral clustering algorithms, which clusters the data with the help of eigenvectors of graph Laplacian matrices. We develop new methods to establish that, for increasing sample size, those eigenvectors converge to the eigenvectors of certain limit operators. As a result, we can prove that one of the two major classes of spectral clustering (normalized clustering) converges under very general conditions, while the other (unnormalized clustering) is only consistent under strong additional assumptions, which are not always satisfied in real data. We conclude that our analysis provides strong evidence for the superiority of normalized spectral clustering.},

For this reason, a non-invasive tool using skin autofluorescence (AF) quantification that correlates with levels of tissue AGEs has been developed. The present study aimed to assess whether or not skin AF is associated with microvascular complications in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods All consecutive patients with T1D (n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;133) had three AF measures taken on the forearm, using illumination with a fluorescent tube, all on the same day after breakfast or lunch. Potential associations between skin AF levels and microvascular complications, age, diabetes duration and health status were then assessed using a multivariate linear-regression model. Results On age-adjusted analyses, diabetes duration, retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy were significantly associated with skin AF levels (all P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.001). AF levels increased significantly with severity in both retinopathy and nephropathy (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.001). After adjusting for age, diabetes duration, HbA1c, smoking, retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, the association of AF levels remained significant with nephropathy and neuropathy, but not with retinopathy and diabetes duration. Conclusion This study suggests an independent association between skin AF levels and diabetic nephropathy and neuropathy, but not retinopathy, in T1D patients. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the ability of skin AF levels to predict microangiopathy.},

abstract = {Abstract Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a polygenic disorder where loci within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) account for most of the genetic susceptibility. Nongenetic factors, most likely environmental, are also involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, resulting in T-cell--mediated autoimmune attack against pancreatic beta cells. Although our understanding of the natural history of T1D has significantly improved during the last decades, the pathogenesis of the disease remains elusive as are successful strategies for primary intervention. Interesting findings are expected from the emerging field of microRNAs (miRNAs), a family of endogenous small noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. They play a key role in post-transcriptional regulation by selectively binding complementary messenger RNAs, thus affecting translation. miRNAs affect key biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, development, and metabolism. In addition, miRNAs are also involved in the regulation of the immune system and insulin secretion. Interestingly, miRNAs have been identified in both normal and pathological conditions, functioning as predictive markers in certain human diseases. Herein, we have discussed the potential application of this new field to T1D. Research in this area may help to identify variations in genes coding for selected miRNAs that may contribute to diabetes susceptibility. In addition, mechanistic studies on the role of miRNAs in the modulation of the immune system may elucidate important regulatory mechanisms, identifing potential therapeutic targets to ameliorate responses to islet tranplantation.},

A total of 19,164 cases were diagnosed in study populations totaling 75.1 million children. The annual incidence rates were calculated per 100,000 population.RESULTS - The overall age-adjusted incidence of type 1 diabetes varied from 0.1/100,000 per year in China and Venezuela to 36.8/100,000 per year in Sardinia and 36.5/100,000 per year in Finland. This represents a {\&}gt;350-fold variation in the incidence among the 100 populations worldwide. The global pattern of variation in incidence was evaluated by arbitrarily grouping the populations with a very low ({\&}lt;1/100,000 per year), a low (1-4.99/100,000 per year), an intermediate (5-9.99/100,000 per year), a high (10-19.99/100,000 per year), and a very high ( greater than or equal to 20/100,000 per year) incidence. Of the European populations, 18 of 39 had an intermediate incidence, and the remainder had a high or very high incidence. A very high incidence (greater than or equal to 20/ 100,000 per year) was found in Sardinia, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Portugal, the U.K., Canada, and New Zealand. The lowest incidence ({\&}lt;1/100,000 per year) was found in the populations from China and South America. Tn most populations, the incidence increased with age and was the highest among children 10-14 years of age.CONCLUSIONS - The range of global variation in the incidence of childhood type 1 diabetes is even larger than previously described. The earlier reported polar-equatorial gradient in the incidence does not seem to be as strong as preciously assumed, bur the variation seems to follow ethnic and racial distribution in the world population.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) susceptibility locus, IDDM8, has been accurately mapped to 200 kilobases at the terminal end of chromosome 6q27. This is within the region which harbours a cluster of three genes encoding proteasome subunit beta 1 (PMSB1), TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and a homologue of mouse programming cell death activator 2 (PDCD2). In this study, we evaluated whether these genes contribute to T1D susceptibility using the transmission disequilibrium test of the data set from 114 affected Russian simplex families. The A allele of the G/A1180 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the PDCD2 gene, which was significant in its preferential transfer from parents to diabetic children (75 transmissions vs. 47 non-transmissions, $\chi$2=12.85, P corrected=0.0038), was found to be associated with T1D. G/A1180 dimorphism and two other SNPs, C/T771 TBP and G/T(−271) PDCD2, were shown to share three common haplotypes, two of which (A-T-G and A-T-T) have been associated with higher development risk of T1D. The third haplotype (G-T-G) was related to having a lower risk of disease. These findings suggest that the PDCD2 gene is a likely susceptibility gene for T1D within IDDM8. However, it was not possible to exclude the TBP gene from being another putative susceptibility gene in this region.},

The CFA-injected, diabetes-free DP rats had normal levels of pancreatic insulin and little or no mononuclear leukocyte infiltration in the islets. These protective effects of CFA were not associated with any changes in peripheral blood leukocyte counts or monoclonal antibody-defined T cell, B cell, or macrophage subsets in the spleen of the DP rats. These results suggest that it is possible to prevent diabetes by adjuvant treatment in early life without general immunosuppression or sustained therapy.},

In this study, we found that the interferon $\gamma$-inducible protein 10 plays an important role in triggering $\beta$ cell destruction. Islets isolated from patients with T2DM secreted CXCL10 and contained 33.5-fold more CXCL10 mRNA than islets from control patients. Pancreatic sections from obese nondiabetic individuals and patients with T2DM and T1DM expressed CXCL10 in $\beta$ cells. Treatment of human islets with CXCL10 decreased $\beta$ cell viability, impaired insulin secretion, and decreased insulin mRNA. CXCL10 induced sustained activation of Akt, JNK, and cleavage of p21-activated protein kinase 2 (PAK-2), switching Akt signals from proliferation to apoptosis. These effects were not mediated by the commonly known CXCL10 receptor CXCR3 but through TLR4. Our data suggest CXCL10 as a binding partner for TLR4 and as a signal toward $\beta$ cell failure in diabetes.},

Phenotypic analysis of NK cells was performed by flow cytometry before and after the transfer. The proportion of subfertile NOD female mice that failed to become pregnant when co-caged with C57Bl/6 males for 16 weeks was significantly higher in female NOD mice than in normal female BALB/c controls (53.1% versus 15.1%; P {\&}lt; 0.01). The subfertile NOD mice were divided into three groups receiving CD25+ NK cells (group 1), CD25− cells (group 2) or RPMI 1640 medium only (group 3). Group 1 had significantly more pregnancies than those receiving CD25− NK cells (77.8% versus 11.1%; P {\&}lt; 0.01) and controls injected with RPMI 1640 medium (0.0%; P {\&}lt; 0.01). Improved fertility was concomitant with an increase in placental CD49b+ NK cells expressing Foxp3. Foxp3 expression was confirmed in the CD25+ NK cells before the transfer. These results indicate that subfertility in NOD mice may be partially attributed to the insufficiency of CD25+ and Foxp3+ NK cells recruited into the pregnant uterus.},

abstract = {A large body of data generated during the past two decades has led to the ability to predict the development of Type I diabetes in the majority of relatives of diabetics. In particular we have recently proposed a dual parameter linear model to aid in predicting the onset of diabetes [years to diabetes = 1.5 + .03(IVGTT insulin secretion) − 0.008 (concn of insulin autoantibodies)]. The concentration of insulin autoantibodies in prediabetics appears to remarkably correlate with the age at which diabetes develops and the rate at which islet cell antibody-positive individuals progress to diabetes. Children developing diabetes before Age 5 often express more than 1000 nU/ml of such antibodies with the upper limit of normal of 39 nU/ml. Each prediabetic appears to be set at a characteristic level of insulin autoantibodies which does not consistently vary prior to the development of diabetes. During the prodromal phase preceding diabetes first phase insulin secretion is progressively lost, and the combination of insulin release which appears to reflect $\beta$ cell damage and the level of insulin antibodies accounts for more than 75% of the variation in time to diabetes over a 6-year interval. A subset of NOD mice also expresses insulin autoantibodies, and in addition essentially all NOD mice, but not F1 crosses of NOD by BALBc, have antibodies to a target antigen of a RIN islet line protein (termed ``polar antibodies''). In addition patients but not NOD mice have cytoplasmic islet cell antibodies which appear to react with a glycolipid islet target antigen. In the NOD mice the inheritance of disease is multigenic with a gene on chromosome 9, linked to the T cell marker $\theta$, determining the bulk of islet cell destruction. In crosses of NOD mice with a series of normal strains, inheritance overt diabetes is correlated with inheritance of the NOD's unique I-A $\beta$ gene, though the bulk of islet destruction and insulitis can occur independent of MHC inheritance. Until the additional genes outside of the MHC, associated with the development of Type I diabetes, are identified for man, the NOD mouse, and the BB rat, one can only speculate concerning pathogenic mechanisms. To date islet cell destruction appears to be independent of polymorphic genes acting at the level of the islet target, and crucially dependent upon bone marrow precursor cells. In summary Type I diabetes is now a predictable autoimmune disease, in which immunomodulation can prevent the disorder in animal models, and for which safer modalities of immunomodulation are required for treatment of pre-Type I diabetics.},

abstract = {Summary There is a discrepancy between the in vitro anergic state of CD4+CD25hiFoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and their in vivo proliferative capability. The underlying mechanism of this paradox is unknown. Here we show that the anergic state of Treg cells depends on the elevated activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway induced by leptin: a transient inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin, before T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, made Treg cells highly proliferative in the absence of exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2). This was a dynamic and oscillatory phenomenon characterized by an early downregulation of the leptin-mTOR pathway followed by an increase in mTOR activation necessary for Treg cell expansion to occur. These data suggest that energy metabolism, through the leptin-mTOR-axis, sets responsiveness of Treg cells that use this information to control immune tolerance and autoimmunity.},

Experimentally induced models of autoimmunity have been shown to be prevented or reduced in intensity in mice rendered deficient for CD28 costimulation. In sharp contrast, spontaneous diabetes is exacerbated in both B7-1/B7-2-deficient and CD28-deficient NOD mice. These mice present a profound decrease of the immunoregulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells, which control diabetes in prediabetic NOD mice. These cells are absent from both CD28KO and B7-1/B7-2KO mice, and the transfer of this regulatory T cell subset from control NOD animals into CD28-deficient animals can delay/prevent diabetes. The results suggest that the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway is essential for the development and homeostasis of regulatory T cells that control spontaneous autoimmune diseases.},

Furthermore, a more recent study has revealed that macrophages suppressive against a variety of lymphocyte functions can be induced by BCG, which suggests that these macrophages are involved in the suppression of the pathogenesis. To obtain valid evidence for this speculation, the effects of transfer of macrophage and T-cell fractions on the pathogenesis were examined in the present study. Transfer of macrophage-enriched spleen cell fraction harvested from the BCG-treated females to young females abolished the occurrence of spontaneous diabetes up to the age of 25 to 30 weeks. Also, macrophage transfer prevented the progress of insulitis. In contrast, transfer of a T-cellenriched fraction did not suppress insulitis and overt diabetes. From these results, it could be concluded that the suppression of the autoimmune pathogenesis of diabetes by BCG is due to the generation of suppressor macrophages.},

In vivo, treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 or its analogs prevents diabetes in NOD mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the 1,25(OH)2D3-analog TX527 on the expression of antigen-presenting and costimulatory/migratory molecules on BM-derived DCs from NOD mice. After culture with 20{\&}{\#}xa0;ng/ml GM-CSF+20{\&}{\#}xa0;ng/ml IL-4 (8 days) followed by 1000{\&}{\#}xa0;ng/ml LPS+100{\&}{\#}xa0;U/ml IFN-$\gamma$ (2 days), with or without 10−8{\&}{\#}xa0;M TX527, cells were counted and analyzed by FACS for MHC II, CD86, CD40 and CD54 expression within the CD11c+ DC population. Upon TX527 treatment, cell recovery was significantly reduced whereas the CD11c+ DC fraction remained constant. On CD11c+ DCs, MHC II, CD86 and CD54 were significantly down-regulated and CD40 was twofold upregulated. Globally, BM-derived DCs from NOD mice become more tolerogenic upon TX527 treatment, confirming the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on murine DCs and possibly explaining the protective effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs from diabetes in NOD mice.},

In the last decade, there has been a remarkable resurgence in research on suppressor or regulatory T cells. Few areas have captivated the attention of immunologists so vividly and entertained so many passionate debates. Indeed, CD4+CD25+ Treg, which are at the very center of this fascination, have emerged as a dominant T cell population capable of mediating peripheral tolerance to autoantigens, but whose functions have now been extended to regulation of T cell responses directed to foreign antigens. However, a number of fundamental questions concerning the origin, phenotypic nature and mechanism of action of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells remain elusive and misunderstood. We propose the existence of two general subsets of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells, naturally-occurring and induced, that differ in their origin, developmental and activation requirements, and mechanism of action.},

abstract = {Type I diabetes mellitus is an immune-mediated disease that is known to be associated and linked with genes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromome 6. Functionally, HLA class I antigen presentation may be deranged in type I diabetes. The TAP1 and TAP2 transporters, which mediate the translocation of antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum and whose genes are located in the HLA class II region, are potential candidates for conferrring predisposition to type I diabetes. Five known coding region variants (codons 379, 565, 651, 665, and 687) as well as three new polymorphisms of TAP2, one silent (codon 604) and two intronic (nucleotide positions 49,270 and 49,471), were typed in a cohort of 146 well-characterized Finnish individuals with type I diabetes and 90 control subjects. Absolute linkage disequilibrium was apparent for the polymorphisms at codons 604, 665, and 687 as well as the two downstream intronic polymorphisms in a 613-bp region of the 3′ portion of TAP2; the polymorphism at codon 651, which is also present within this region, was excluded from this linkage. The codon 651 polymorphism defines the allele TAP2F, the frequency of which in HLA-DR4+ diabetic subjects was 5.4 times that in DR4+ controls (27 vs. 5%, p = 0.002, pc = 0.01). These data are consistent with the existence of susceptibility haplotypes for type I diabetes in the Finnish population consisting of DRB1∗04 (∗0401 and ∗0404), DQ8, and TAP2F.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by the selective destruction of the insulin-producing $\beta$ cells. Research into the pathogenesis of T1D has been hindered by the lack of detection of the autoimmune process during the asymptomatic period and by the inaccessibility to the target tissue. Therefore current understanding of the immunological phenomena that take place in the pancreas of the patients is very limited and much of the current knowledge on T1D has been obtained using animal models. Microarray technology and bioinformatics allow the comparison of the gene expression profile -- transcriptome -- in normal and pathological conditions, creating a global picture of altered processes. Microarray experiments have defined new transcriptional alterations associated with several autoimmune diseases, and are focused on the identification of specific biomarkers. In this review we summarize current data on gene expression profiles in T1D from an immunological point of view. Reported transcriptome studies have been performed in T1D patients and Non-Obese Diabetic mouse models analyzing peripheral blood, lymphoid organs and pancreas/islets. In the periphery, the distinctive profiles are inflammatory pathways inducible by IL-1$\beta$ and IFNs that can help in the identification of new biomarkers. In the target organ, a remarkable finding is the overexpression of inflammatory and innate immune response genes and the active autoimmune response at longstanding stages, contrary to the pre-existing concept of acute autoimmune process in T1D.},

abstract = {Gastrointestinal transit (GI) in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, an animal model of human diabetes type 1, was examined in animals with short- (duration 1--5 days) and long-term (duration 28--35 days) diabetes. Blood glucose level, serum insulin concentration, and gut neuroendocrine peptide content were also measured. GI was significantly rapid in NOD mice with long-term diabetes (LTD), but was not correlated with blood glucose level, serum insulin concentration, or pancreatic insulin content. GI was correlated with duodenal secretin content, but not with the content of other neuroendocrine peptides in the different segments investigated. Whereas antral vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) content in NOD mice with LTD was significantly higher, colonic VIP was lower in NOD mice with short-term diabetes (STD). In the duodenum, whereas the concentration of secretin in NOD mice with both STD and LTD was lower, the gastrin content was higher. Duodenal somatostatin content in NOD mice with LTD was lower. In colon, the content of galanin in NOD mice with LTD was higher than in controls. The decreased content of secretin may be among the factors that cause rapid GI in NOD mice with LTD. Changes in the antral content of VIP, duodenal somatostatin, and colonic galanin in NOD mice with LTD may cause low intestinal secretion and, together with rapid GI, give rise to diarrhoea, which is a common symptom in diabetes.},

Study design A retrospective chart review was performed of patients ages 0-20 years at diagnosis of T1D and type 2 diabetes who were seen at the BDC, were living within Colorado at diagnosis, and were seen within 1 month of diagnosis between 1996 and 2010. The review included age of onset, sex, month and season of onset, islet autoantibodies, diabetes type, hemoglobin A1c level, and body mass index. Results Newly diagnosed youth with diabetes (n = 2841) were seen at the BDC between 1996 and 2010. Of these, 2686 (94.4%) had T1D. The number of newly diagnosed youth increased over the 15 years by 5.71% per year when adjusted for population (P {\&}lt; .0001). When analyzed in 5-year periods, the average number of new onset T1D cases, age-adjusted to the population, increased by 9.46% per year from 1996-2000 to 2001-2005. The increase was only 4.86% per year from 2001-2005 to 2006-2010. Islet autoimmune markers appeared to correlate with changes in T1D new onset cases. Conclusion T1D in youth increased significantly from the late 1990s-2005 and has increased at a lesser rate more recently. Data suggests that even though T1D has increased in all age groups, the greatest increase was in the 5-9 year age category.},

Thus, the relative proportion of adolescents and young adults with a very long duration of type-1 diabetes may gradually increase. Early-onset diabetes may increase the lifetime risk for diabetic vascular complications, although there are other factors -- such as long-term glycaemic control, puberty, and familial and genetic factors -- which contribute to the overall risk. The focus of this minireview is the natural history of microalbuminuria in children and adolescents with type-1 diabetes. Late complications in type-1 diabetes are almost always subclinical during childhood and adolescence, and advanced vascular complications are rarely seen. Microalbuminuria may appear as the first sign of microvascular complications, and although it may be intermittent or transient in most young patients, screening is important in clinical diabetes care since microalbuminuria is also a strong risk marker for early cardiovascular morbidity.},

However, the optimal time points for HSCT are still unknown. Methods By using multiple low-dose streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1D mice models, we performed syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (syn-BMT) in diabetic mice at various time points new-onset day 3 (n = 12); new-onset day 10 (n = 13); later-onset day 20 (n = 12); and day 40 (n = 7), respectively. At 120 days after syn-BMT, we examined pancreata histology, serum insulin, and CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs). Results Our previous results showed that syn-BMT can overcome diabetes when performed on day 10, but not at day 40. Our new data showed BMT only attenuated diabetes when done on day 3 or day 20. Moreover, the percentage of Tregs in the spleen correlated with the attenuation of hyperglycemia. Significance These results indicated that syn-BMT should be performed, when diabetes is neither too new-onset nor too late-stage. Tregs represent one mechanism for syn-BMT-induced restoration of immune tolerance in STZ-diabetic mice.},

abstract = {Cyclophosphamide (CY), an alkylating cytostatic drug, is known for its ability to accelerate a number of experimental autoimmune diseases including spontaneous diabetes in NOD mice. The mechanism(s) by which CY renders autoreactive lymphocytes more pathogenic is largely unknown, but it has been postulated that the drug preferentially depletes regulatory (suppressor) T cells. It has been suggested that in cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, Th2-like lymphocytes secreting IL-4 and/or IL-10 provide protection, while Th1-like cells secreting IFN-$\gamma$ are pathogenic. In this study, we analysed the effects of CY on autoimmune diabetes and cytokines in two mouse models: the spontaneous diabetes of NOD mice and the diabetes induced in C57BL/KsJ mice by multiple injections of low dose streptozotocin (LD-STZ). In both models, CY induced severe lymphopenia and accelerated the progression to hyperglycemia. This was associated with changes in splenic cytokine patterns indicating a shift towards the IFN-$\gamma$-secreting phenotype. We provide here evidence that IFN-$\gamma$ producers are relatively resistant to depletion by CY and that Th0 clones can be shifted towards Th1. However, direct exposure of T lymphocytes to CY may not be a necessary condition for exacerbation of diabetes; NOD.scid mice treated with CY before adoptive transfer of NOD splenocytes developed diabetes at a higher rate than did controls. Thus, the acceleration of diabetes by CY seems to be a complex event, which includes the relatively high resistance of IFN-$\gamma$ producers to the drug, their rapid reconstitution, and a Th1 shift of surviving T cell clones.},

We used cDNA microarray technology to identify genes differentially regulated in splenocytes of T1D prone NOD mice after immunization with a disease protective glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65 P14) peptide. We identified 96 genes involved in cytokine secretion, humoral immune response, T cell activation, signal transduction, cell proliferation, complement activation and inflammatory responses. Up-regulation of seven chemokine and cytokine genes confirmed our previous findings of increased interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$) secretion, which may lead to a protective response in T1D. Hierarchical clustering was used to organize treated and control groups on the basis of their overall similarity in gene-expression patterns, suggesting association or co-regulation. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm the expression of selected genes in spleen and pancreatic draining lymph nodes. These findings can be used to compare other immunization strategies affecting the expression of these genes and explore their mechanisms of action. This microarray-based study, thus, unravels the molecular mechanism of $\beta$-cell associated autoantigenic peptide immunization in T1D prone NOD mice, paving the way for identification of diagnostic markers and drug targets for modulating immune responses in T1D.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by the destruction of pancreatic insulin-producing $\beta$ cells by autoreactive T cells early in life. Despite daily insulin injections, patients typically develop cardiovascular and other complications; and intensive efforts are being directed toward identifying therapeutic targets to prevent the disease without directly impinging on the host defense. Fas ligand (FasL) is one potential target. Fas-FasL interactions primarily regulate T-cell homeostasis, not activation. Nevertheless, spontaneous gene mutation of Fas (called lpr mutation) or FasL (called the gld mutation) prevents autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, the widely used model for T1D. Furthermore, although homozygous gld mutations cause age-dependent lymphoproliferation, limiting the gld mutation to one allele (NOD-gld/+) or treating NOD--wild-type mice with FasL-neutralizing monoclonal antibody completely prevents the disease development without causing lymphoproliferation or immune suppression. Herein, we show that the heterozygous gld mutation inhibits the accumulation of diabetogenic T cells in the pancreas, without interfering with their proliferation and expansion in the draining pancreatic lymph nodes. Pancreata from NOD-gld/+ mice contained B cells that expressed CD5 and produced IL-10, which was critical for maintenance of the disease resistance because its neutralization with an IL-10 receptor--blocking monoclonal antibody allowed accumulation of CD4 T cells in the pancreas and led to insulitis development. The results provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of T1D that could have important therapeutic implications.},

Is p277 the only hsp60 peptide able to modulate the disease? We mapped T cell responses to peptides spanning the mouse hsp60 molecule and identified an immunogenic peptide, designated p12, that is also functional in arresting NOD diabetes. Although no spontaneous T cell reactivity to p12 could be detected in NOD mice, subcutaneous administration of 100{\&}{\#}xa0;$\mu$g of p12 in mineral oil to 10-week-old female NOD mice, similar to treatment with p277, significantly prevented progression of the disease. Administration of other immunogenic peptides was not effective. A peptide from the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) sequence, GADp35, and a peptide from the myco-bacterial hsp60 molecule did not influence the development of diabetes. The effectiveness of hsp60 peptides p12 and p277 was associated with the induction of antibodies to the peptides of the IgG1 and IgG2b isotypes, antibodies which appear to be regulated by anti-inflammatory cytokines. There was a negative correlation between the amounts of antibodies induced by the hsp60 peptides and the level of blood glucose. Thus, more than one peptide of the hsp60 molecule can be used to inhibit the development of NOD diabetes, and the effect of peptide therapy appears to be associated with the induction of specific antibody isotypes.},

These include cyclophosphamide sensitive T regulatory cells (Treg cells) and Th2 derived cytokine downregulation. We used the model of multiple low doses of streptozotocin (MLD-STZ) induced diabetes in susceptible C57BL/6 mice and resistant BALB/c mice to study these regulatory mechanisms. We show that low dose cyclophosphamide (CY) sensitive CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cell-dependent mechanisms can be demonstrated in C57Bl/6 mice susceptible to MLD-STZ diabetes induction. CY pretreatment decreased Foxp3+ cell count, glycemia, glycosuria and insulitis. In contrast, CY did not overcome resistance to diabetes induction in BALB/c mice. However, in BALB/c mice, deletion of ST2, an orphan member of the IL-1R family responsible for Th2 cell signaling leads to enhanced susceptibility to diabetes induction as evaluated by level of glycemia and glycosuria, number of infiltrating cells and $\beta$ cell loss. RT-PCR analysis of mRNA transcripts of diabetogenic cytokines revealed that the expression of TNF-$\alpha$, and IFN-$\gamma$ was significantly enhanced in pancreatic lymph nodes by day 10 after diabetes induction in ST2-deficient mice in comparison with wild type BALB/c mice while IL-17 was detected only in ST2−/− mice by day 21. Our results are compatible with the notion that Treg cells are involved in MLD-STZ diabetes in susceptible mice and demonstrate that ST2-mediated signaling may also be involved in limiting Th1/Th17-mediated autoimmune pathology in diabetes resistant strain.},

abstract = {Summary Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a key mediator of innate immunity, the insufficiency of which is caused by point mutations in the MBL2 gene. MBL insufficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to infections and certain autoimmune diseases, but its impact in the pathogenesis and risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is controversial. We investigated the significance of the MBL2 genotype on the risk of T1D in a Finnish study population comprising 470 diabetic children and 501 controls. Furthermore, the effect of MBL2 gene polymorphism on the emergence of $\beta$-cell autoantibodies in 289 unaffected children with human leukocyte antigen-conferred susceptibility to T1D was assessed. MBL genotype had no significant effect on the risk or onset age of T1D. However, children with the biallelic variant genotype reflecting total MBL deficiency tested positive more frequently for ≥3 autoantibodies compared with children with another genotype (odds ratio = 6.0, 95% confidence interval 1.3--28; p = 0.013). In conclusion, the MBL2 genotype did not affect susceptibility to T1D in children, and this finding does not support previous reports implicating a role of the MBL2 genotype as a factor predisposing to T1D. The association of the biallelic variant genotype with positivity for multiple autoantibodies suggests that intermolecular epitope spreading may be linked with impaired clearance of autoantigens as a result of MBL deficiency.},

Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an apoptotic cell-based therapy used clinically for immune-mediated disorders. In this study, we examined the effect that intravenous delivery of apoptotic cells (ECP-treated) has in the prevention of T1D in NOD mice. We discovered that five weekly injections of ECP-treated NOD spleen cells, beginning at 8 weeks of age, significantly delayed diabetes onset. Furthermore, cell dose studies demonstrated that low dose ECP-treated spleen cells (2{\&}{\#}xa0;×{\&}{\#}xa0;105 cells/injection/mouse) had similar protective effects as compared to high dose (5{\&}{\#}xa0;×{\&}{\#}xa0;106 cells/injection). In contrast to ECP-treated cells alone, ECP-treated cells combined with $\beta$ cell antigens appeared to improve the protective effect as shown by the marked reduction in insulitis in the islets. Delivery of ECP-treated spleen cells or ECP-treated spleen cells plus $\beta$ cell antigen increased Foxp3+ Tregs, and $\beta$ cell antigen-specific T cell proliferation was significantly suppressed in vivo in these two groups. In addition, we found that ECP-treated cells did not induce global immunosuppression or autoimmunity against nuclear antigens. In conclusion, ECP-treated cells provide a safe and effective approach in T1D prevention, suggesting that clinical ECP has great potential for managing human T1D.},

Intracellular oxidation of 2′7′-dichlorofluorescin by H2O2 was analyzed by flow cytometry.

The generation of H2O2 by M{\o} in islet cells from treated mice was less marked than that in controls.

Here we report that infiltrated mouse islets (``translucent islets'') can be identified visually. We demonstrate the use of an efficient method for the isolation and culture of the islet-infiltrating cells of NOD mice, which results in a high percentage of CD8+ T cells after seven days, with minimal manipulation. We show that islet-infiltrating cells exit the islets soon after they are placed in culture and can be used in flow cytometric experiments several hours later. Importantly, we demonstrate that the cultured cells are antigen-responsive and that specificities present at the beginning of the culture are generally still present on day seven. In addition, some reactivities are undetected without culture, supporting the validity of the seven-day expansion period. This technique greatly facilitates investigations of the CD8+ T cell reactivities that play a pivotal role in the demise of pancreatic beta cells leading to the development of T1D.},

Antigen-specific immunotherapies are used to selectively tolerize $\beta$ cell-specific pathogenic T cells either directly, or indirectly through the induction of immunoregulatory T cells. A key concern of antigen-specific immunotherapy is exacerbating autoimmunity. We compared the T cell reactivity and efficacy induced by plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) administered via intramuscular versus gene gun vaccination in NOD mice at a late preclinical stage of T1D. Whereas intramuscular injection of pGAD65 promoted a predominant type 1 CD4+ T cell response and failed to suppress ongoing $\beta$ cell autoimmunity, gene gun vaccination preferentially induced IL-4 secreting CD4+ T cells and significantly delayed the onset of diabetes. These findings demonstrate that gene gun delivery of autoantigen-encoding pDNA preferentially elicits immunoregulatory T cells and offers a safe, effective mode of pDNA vaccination for the treatment of T1D and other autoimmune diseases.},

We evaluated three patients who had suffered from type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance for 5--30 years. After an episode of diabetic mononeuropathy or poor glycemic control, they started human insulin therapy. All the patients' serum or urinary C-peptide levels were preserved before insulin therapy, whereas within a few months they rapidly declined to below detection limits. A high titer of insulin antibody was detected at or after the development of insulin deficiency. Shortly after the initiation of insulin therapy, two of the patients developed an insulin allergy. Autoantibodies to GAD65 or IA-2 were negative throughout the clinical course in two cases, but transiently positive in one case. In a histological examination of pancreas tissue obtained by a pancreatic biopsy in one case, mononuclear cell infiltration into the islets was observed. They all had a type 1 diabetes high-risk HLA class II haplotype in Japanese, and class I alleles of the insulin gene VNTR. The above findings suggest that insulin administration may have triggered pancreatic $\beta$-cell destruction in these patients.},

abstract = {In insulin dependent diabetes mellitis (IDDM) beta cell destruction is associated with infiltration of the pancreatic islets by T lymphocytes and macrophages. Cytokine products from the infiltrating immunocytes not only have powerful immunoregulatory actions but also are capable of impairing islet cell functions and have thus been postulated to assume a central role in mediating anti-beta cell immunity and beta cell destruction. In an effort to explore further the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of IDDM, we examined clinical, metabolic and pathological features of NOD/Wehi mice injected intraperitoneally with multiple doses of IFN-$\gamma$ and/or TNF-$\alpha$. Blood glucose profiles were not significantly altered by injection of cytokines alone or in combination. Except for a hypoglycaemic rebound in mice injected with TNF-$\alpha$, arginine stimulation tests revealed no disturbances in islet secretory function in cytokine injected mice. Compared with vehicle and cytokines alone, injection of IFN-$\gamma$ + TNF-$\alpha$ was associated with a variety of clinical and pathological changes including abdominal distention, piloerection, ascites, oedema, thymic atrophy, splenic enlargement and pancreatic distention. Histological examination of the pancreas in these mice revealed moderate to severe pancreatitis which included focal haemorrhagic necrosis, oedema and polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell infiltration. The islets in these mice appeared normal morphologically and when stained for insulin. The injection of IFN-$\gamma$ + TNF-$\alpha$, and to a lesser extent TNF-$\alpha$ alone, was associated with a significant reduction in the severity of insulitis. Examination of pancreatic MHC-class I and class II molecule expression revealed in mice given IFN-$\gamma$ + TNF-$\alpha$, as compared with controls, significant and uniform induction of both these molecules on ductal and acinar cells; low level MHC-class II expression was also detectable on beta cells in these mice. MHC-class I molecules which were expressed at high levels by beta cells in control mice did not appear to change following administration of the cytokines alone or in combination. We conclude that despite their immunostimulatory actions in vitro and in other models in vivo, systemic administration of the cytokines IFN-$\gamma$ and/or TNF-$\alpha$ to NOD/Wehi mice does not activate or enhance, and may actually suppress, anti-beta cell immunity in this model.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:Monozygotic twins are usually discordant (only one twin affected) for type 1 diabetes. Discordance for disease between such twins implies a role for nongenetically determined factors but could also be influenced by a decreased load of diabetes susceptibility genes. The aim of this study was to determine whether two susceptibility genes were less prevalent in discordant twins compared with concordant twins.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:We studied 77 monozygotic twin pairs (INS), 40 concordant and 37 discordant, for type 1 diabetes at polymorphism of the insulin gene region on chromosome 11 p and HLA-DQBI.

RESULTS:The disease-associated INS genotype (Hph I) was identified in 87.5% of the concordant twins but only in 59.5% (P = 0.005) of the discordant twins. Neither DQB1*0201 nor DQB1*0302 was seen in 2 of 40 (5%) concordant twins compared with 8 of 37 (22%) discordant twins (P = 0.04). No statistical differences were seen between concordant and discordant twins at individual alleles of DQB1. Combining insulin and DQ data, 5% of concordant twins compared with 32.4% of discordant twins had neither DQB1*0201/DQB1*0302 nor the high-risk Hph I INS "++" genotype (P = 0.002).

CONCLUSIONS:We conclude that the possession of the high-risk Hph I insulin genotype increases the likelihood of identical twins being concordant for type 1 diabetes and that the "load" of both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and non-MHC susceptibility genes has an impact on the disease penetrance of type 1 diabetes.},

abstract = {The direct involvement of the human leukocyte antigen class II DR-DQ genes in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is well established, and these genes display a complex hierarchy of risk effects at the genotype and haplotype levels. We investigated, using data from 38 studies, whether the DR-DQ haplotypes and genotypes show the same relative predispositional effects across populations and ethnic groups. Significant differences in risk within a population were considered, as well as comparisons across populations using the patient/control (P/C) ratio. Within a population, the ratio of the P/C ratios for two different genotypes or haplotypes is a function only of the absolute penetrance values, allowing ranking of risk effects. Categories of consistent predisposing, intermediate ('neutral'), and protective haplotypes were identified and found to correlate with disease prevalence and the marked ethnic differences in DRB1-DQB1 frequencies. Specific effects were identified, for example for predisposing haplotypes, there was a statistically significant and consistent hierarchy for DR4 DQB1*0302s: DRB1*0405 =*0401 =*0402 > *0404 > *0403, with DRB1*0301 DQB1*0200 (DR3) being significantly less predisposing than DRB1*0402 and more than DRB1*0404. The predisposing DRB1*0401 DQB1*0302 haplotype was relatively increased compared with the protective haplotype DRB1*0401 DQB1*0301 in heterozygotes with DR3 compared with heterozygotes with DRB1*0101 DQB1*0501 (DR1). Our results show that meta-analyses and use of the P/C ratio and rankings thereof can be valuable in determining T1D risk factors at the haplotype and amino acid residue levels.},

abstract = {The final pathway of beta cell destruction leading to insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and clinical type 1 diabetes is unknown. Here we show that circulating CTLs can kill beta cells via recognition of a glucose-regulated epitope. First, we identified 2 naturally processed epitopes from the human preproinsulin signal peptide by elution from HLA-A2 (specifically, the protein encoded by the A*0201 allele) molecules. Processing of these was unconventional, requiring neither the proteasome nor transporter associated with processing (TAP). However, both epitopes were major targets for circulating effector CD8+ T cells from HLA-A2+ patients with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, cloned preproinsulin signal peptide-specific CD8+ T cells killed human beta cells in vitro. Critically, at high glucose concentration, beta cell presentation of preproinsulin signal epitope increased, as did CTL killing. This study provides direct evidence that autoreactive CTLs are present in the circulation of patients with type 1 diabetes and that they can kill human beta cells. These results also identify a mechanism of self-antigen presentation that is under pathophysiological regulation and could expose insulin-producing beta cells to increasing cytotoxicity at the later stages of the development of clinical diabetes. Our findings suggest that autoreactive CTLs are important targets for immune-based interventions in type 1 diabetes and argue for early, aggressive insulin therapy to preserve remaining beta cells.},

abstract = {Large-scale association studies hold substantial promise for unraveling the genetic basis of common human diseases. A well-known problem with such studies is the presence of undetected population structure, which can lead to both false positive results and failures to detect genuine associations. Here we examine approximately 15,000 genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms typed in three population groups to assess the consequences of population structure on the coming generation of association studies. The consequences of population structure on association outcomes increase markedly with sample size. For the size of study needed to detect typical genetic effects in common diseases, even the modest levels of population structure within population groups cannot safely be ignored. We also examine one method for correcting for population structure (Genomic Control). Although it often performs well, it may not correct for structure if too few loci are used and may overcorrect in other settings, leading to substantial loss of power. The results of our analysis can guide the design of large-scale association studies.},

abstract = {Killer-cell Ig-like receptors (KIR) are structurally and functionally diverse, and enable human NK cells to survey the expression of individual HLA class I molecules, often altered in infections and tumors. Multiple events of non-reciprocal recombination have contributed to the rapid diversification of KIR. We show that approximately 4.5% of the individuals of a Caucasoid population bear a recombinant allele of KIR3DP1, officially designed KIR3DP1*004, that associates tightly with gene duplications of KIR3DP1, KIR2DL4 and KIR3DL1/KIR3DS1. The KIR3DP1 gene is normally silent, but the recombinant allele carries a novel promoter sequence and, as a consequence, is transcribed in all tested individuals. Messenger RNA of KIR3DP1*004 is made up of six exons; of these, exons 1-5 are similar to, and spliced like, those encoding the leader peptide and Ig-domains of KIR3D. By contrast, exon 6 is homologous to no other human KIR sequence, but only to possible homologs in chimpanzees and rhesus macaques, and encodes a short hydrophilic tail. The putative KIR3DP1*004 product, like those of the related genes LAIR-2 and LILRA3/ILT6/LIR4, is predicted to be secreted to the extracellular medium rather than anchored to the cell membrane.},

abstract = {The fast evolving human KIR gene family encodes variable lymphocyte receptors specific for polymorphic HLA class I determinants. Nucleotide sequences for 24 representative human KIR haplotypes were determined. With three previously defined haplotypes, this gave a set of 12 group A and 15 group B haplotypes for assessment of KIR variation. The seven gene-content haplotypes are all combinations of four centromeric and two telomeric motifs. 2DL5, 2DS5 and 2DS3 can be present in centromeric and telomeric locations. With one exception, haplotypes having identical gene content differed in their combinations of KIR alleles. Sequence diversity varied between haplotype groups and between centromeric and telomeric halves of the KIR locus. The most variable A haplotype genes are in the telomeric half, whereas the most variable genes characterizing B haplotypes are in the centromeric half. Of the highly polymorphic genes, only the 3DL3 framework gene exhibits a similar diversity when carried by A and B haplotypes. Phylogenetic analysis and divergence time estimates, point to the centromeric gene-content motifs that distinguish A and B haplotypes having emerged ~6 million years ago, contemporaneously with the separation of human and chimpanzee ancestors. In contrast, the telomeric motifs that distinguish A and B haplotypes emerged more recently, ~1.7 million years ago, before the emergence of Homo sapiens. Thus the centromeric and telomeric motifs that typify A and B haplotypes have likely been present throughout human evolution. The results suggest the common ancestor of A and B haplotypes combined a B-like centromeric region with an A-like telomeric region.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The human KIR genes are arranged in at least six major gene-content haplotypes, all of which are combinations of four centromeric and two telomeric motifs. Several less frequent or minor haplotypes also exist, including insertions, deletions, and hybridization of KIR genes derived from the major haplotypes. These haplotype structures and their concomitant linkage disequilibrium among KIR genes suggest that more meaningful correlative data from studies of KIR genetics and complex disease may be achieved by measuring haplotypes of the KIR region in total.

RESULTS:Towards that end, we developed a KIR haplotyping method that reports unambiguous combinations of KIR gene-content haplotypes, including both phase and copy number for each KIR. A total of 37 different gene content haplotypes were detected from 4,512 individuals and new sequence data was derived from haplotypes where the detailed structure was not previously available.

CONCLUSIONS:These new structures suggest a number of specific recombinant events during the course of KIR evolution, and add to an expanding diversity of potential new KIR haplotypes derived from gene duplication, deletion, and hybridization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Multi-allelic copy number variants include examples of extensive variation between individuals in the copy number of important genes, most notably genes involved in immune function. The definition of this variation, and analysis of its impact on function, has been hampered by the technical difficulty of large-scale but accurate typing of genomic copy number. The copy-variable alpha-defensin locus DEFA1A3 on human chromosome 8 commonly varies between 4 and 10 copies per diploid genome, and presents considerable challenges for accurate high-throughput typing.

RESULTS:In this study, we developed two paralogue ratio tests and three allelic ratio measurements that, in combination, provide an accurate and scalable method for measurement of DEFA1A3 gene number. We combined information from different measurements in a maximum-likelihood framework which suggests that most samples can be assigned to an integer copy number with high confidence, and applied it to typing 589 unrelated European DNA samples. Typing the members of three-generation pedigrees provided further reassurance that correct integer copy numbers had been assigned. Our results have allowed us to discover that the SNP rs4300027 is strongly associated with DEFA1A3 gene copy number in European samples.

CONCLUSIONS:We have developed an accurate and robust method for measurement of DEFA1A3 copy number. Interrogation of rs4300027 and associated SNPs in Genome-Wide Association Study SNP data provides no evidence that alpha-defensin copy number is a strong risk factor for phenotypes such as Crohn's disease, type I diabetes, HIV progression and multiple sclerosis.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that rare variants play an important role in the etiology of many traits. Although a number of methods have been developed for genetic association analysis of rare variants, they all assume a relatively homogeneous population under study. Such an assumption may not be valid for samples collected from admixed populations such as African Americans and Hispanic Americans as there is a great extent of local variation in ancestry in these populations. To ensure valid and more powerful rare variant association tests performed in admixed populations, we have developed a local ancestry-based weighted dosage test, which is able to take into account local ancestry of rare alleles, uncertainties in rare variant imputation when imputed data are included, and the direction of effect that rare variants exert on phenotypic outcome. We used simulated sequence data to show that our proposed test has controlled type I error rates, whereas na{\"\i}ve application of existing rare variants tests and tests that adjust for global ancestry lead to inflated type I error rates. We showed that our test has higher power than tests without proper adjustment of ancestry. We also applied the proposed method to a candidate gene study on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Our results suggest that it is important to appropriately control for potential population stratification induced by local ancestry difference in the analysis of rare variants in admixed populations.},

abstract = {The results from the second paper of this series are reexamined for markers that are not completely polymorphic. A maximum lod score (MLS) criterion is defined for affected relative pairs. The expected MLS (EMLS) is calculated as a function of the marker polymorphic information content (PIC) for various values of lambda R (relative risk ratio) and different relative types by using simulations. An m-allele model with equal allele frequencies is employed. The EMLS is calculated for two sampling strategies: scheme 1, which uses pairs only, and scheme 2, which also includes additional informative relatives. For scheme 2, the percent of the maximum achievable EMLS (i.e., for a marker with a PIC of 1.0) is approximately equal to the marker PIC value for all relative types. For scheme 1, the EMLS is greatly diminished unless PIC is high, especially for distant relatives. For example, scheme 1 is not cost-effective for sibs unless PIC greater than .7; for second- and third-degree relatives, PIC must be greater than .85. Therefore, in general, it will be worthwhile to type additional relatives in linkage studies using affected pairs. The comparative value of sibs versus distant relatives depends on lambda R, recombination theta, and PIC. For large lambda R and PIC values, distant relatives are preferred. Alternatively, for smaller lambda R and PIC values, sibs are best.},

abstract = {The power to detect disease-susceptibility loci through linkage analysis using pairs of affected relatives and affected-unaffected pairs is examined. Allelic identity by descent (ibd) for a completely polymorphic marker for sibling, uncle-nephew, grandparent-grandchild, half-sib, and first-cousin pairs is considered. Affected-unaffected pairs generally represent a poor strategy. For single-locus models, ibd depends on lambda R, the risk ratio for type R relatives compared with population prevalence, and the recombination fraction theta. The ibd for grandparent-grandchild pairs is least affected by recombination, followed by sibs, half-sib, uncle-nephew, and first-cousin pairs. For diseases with large lambda values and for small theta values, distant relatives offer greater power. For larger theta values, grandparent-grandchild pairs are best; for small lambda values, sibs are best. Additive and multiplicative multilocus models are considered. For the multiplicative model, the same formulas as in the single-locus model apply, except that lambda iR (for the ith contributing locus) is substituted for lambda R. For the additive model, the deviation from null expectation for ibd is divided among all contributing loci. Compared with the multiplicative model, for an additive model there is usually greater advantage in distant relationships. Multipoint analysis using linked marker loci for affected relative pairs is described. Simultaneous use of multiple markers diminishes the effect of recombination and allows for localization of the disease-susceptibility locus.},

abstract = {In order to investigate linkage detection strategies for genetically complex traits, multilocus models of inheritance need to be specified. Here, two types of multilocus model are described: (1) a multiplicative model, representing epistasis (interaction) among loci, and (2) an additive model, which is shown to closely approximate genetic heterogeneity, which is characterized by no interlocus interaction. A ratio lambda R of risk for type R relatives that is compared with population prevalence is defined. For a single-locus model, lambda R - 1 decreases by a factor of two with each degree of relationship. The same holds true for an additive multilocus model. For a multiplicative (epistasis) model, lambda R - 1 decreases more rapidly than by a factor of two with degree of relationship. Examination of lambda R values for various classes of relatives can potentially suggest the presence of multiple loci and epistasis. For example, data for schizophrenia suggest multiple loci in interaction. It is shown in the second paper of this series that lambda R is the critical parameter in determining power to detect linkage by using affected relative pairs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIRs) are surface receptors of natural killer cells that bind to their corresponding Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I ligands, making them interesting candidate genes for HLA-associated autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, allelic and copy number variation in the KIR region effectively mask it from standard genome-wide association studies: single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) probes targeting the region are often discarded by standard genotype callers since they exhibit variable cluster numbers. Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) assays address this issue. However, their cost is prohibitive at the sample sizes required for detecting effects typically observed in complex genetic diseases.

RESULTS:We propose a more powerful and cost-effective alternative, which combines signals from SNPs with more than three clusters found in existing datasets, with qPCR on a subset of samples. First, we showed that noise and batch effects in multiplexed qPCR assays are addressed through normalisation and simultaneous copy number calling of multiple genes. Then, we used supervised classification to impute copy numbers of specific KIR genes from SNP signals. We applied this method to assess copy number variation in two KIR genes, KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1, which are suitable candidates for T1D susceptibility since they encode the only KIR molecules known to bind with HLA-Bw4 epitopes. We find no association between KIR3DL1/3DS1 copy number and T1D in 6744 cases and 5362 controls; a sample size twenty-fold larger than in any previous KIR association study. Due to our sample size, we can exclude odds ratios larger than 1.1 for the common KIR3DL1/3DS1 copy number groups at the 5% significance level.

CONCLUSION:We found no evidence of association of KIR3DL1/3DS1 copy number with T1D, either overall or dependent on HLA-Bw4 epitope. Five other KIR genes, KIR2DS4, KIR2DL3, KIR2DL5, KIR2DS5 and KIR2DS1, in high linkage disequilibrium with KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1, are also unlikely to be significantly associated. Our approach could potentially be applied to other KIR genes to allow cost effective assaying of gene copy number in large samples.},

abstract = {Comprehensive identification and cataloging of copy number variations (CNVs) is required to provide a complete view of human genetic variation. The resolution of CNV detection in previous experimental designs has been limited to tens or hundreds of kilobases. Here we present PennCNV, a hidden Markov model (HMM) based approach, for kilobase-resolution detection of CNVs from Illumina high-density SNP genotyping data. This algorithm incorporates multiple sources of information, including total signal intensity and allelic intensity ratio at each SNP marker, the distance between neighboring SNPs, the allele frequency of SNPs, and the pedigree information where available. We applied PennCNV to genotyping data generated for 112 HapMap individuals; on average, we detected approximately 27 CNVs for each individual with a median size of approximately 12 kb. Excluding common rearrangements in lymphoblastoid cell lines, the fraction of CNVs in offspring not detected in parents (CNV-NDPs) was 3.3%. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of whole-genome fine-mapping of CNVs via high-density SNP genotyping.},

abstract = {Smoking is a major public health problem, but the genetic factors associated with smoking behaviors are not fully elucidated. Here, we have conducted an integrated genome-wide association study to identify common copy number polymorphisms (CNPs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) in Japanese smokers (N = 17,158). Our analysis identified a common CNP with a strong effect on CPD (rs8102683; P=3.8 x 10(-42)) in the 19q13 region, encompassing the CYP2A6 locus. After adjustment for the associated CNP, we found an additional associated SNP (rs11878604; P=9.7 x 10(-30)) located 30 kb downstream of the CYP2A6 gene. Imputation of the CYP2A6 locus revealed that haplotypes underlying the CNP and the SNP corresponded to classical, functional alleles of CYP2A6 gene that regulate nicotine metabolism and explained 2% of the phenotypic variance of CPD (ANOVA F-test P=9.5 x 10(-52)). These haplotypes were also associated with smoking-related diseases, including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and arteriosclerosis obliterans.},

abstract = {Abstract Type 1 diabetes (T1D), an autoimmune disease once thought to be mediated exclusively by $\beta$ cell-specific CD4+ T cells, is now recognized as one in which autoreactive CD8+ T cells play a fundamental role. In the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model, CD8+ T effector cells take centre stage in the destruction of pancreatic $\beta$ cells and contribute to sustaining islet inflammation. Recent investigations have elucidated the mechanisms underlying the activation, homing, and beta cell destructive properties of this type of cells. Another important area is the development and testing of novel preemptive or therapeutic ``vaccines'' that, by targeting effector and/or regulatory autoreactive CD8+ T cell specificities may be able to induce immunological tolerance to $\beta$ cells. In humans, our understanding of the role of CD8+ T cells in T1D is also growing, through genetic linkage analyses, as well as epitope identification and characterization of disease-relevant CD8+ T cell responses in patient blood samples. The following review discusses these important advances andhow they can converge towards the goal of developing an antigen-specific immunotherapy for T1D.},

HLA class II proteins play a central role in T cell selection and activation. They bind peptide fragments derived from protein antigens and display them on the cell surface for interaction with the antigen-specific receptors of T lymphocytes. Allelic variation among the HLA class II molecules of different individuals accounts for the functional differences revealed by HLA typing specificities, allograft reactivity, and, most important, differential ability to bind and display antigenic peptides. The chapter also examines the bioinformatic tools that enable the computational identification of T cell epitopes, such as autoantigenic peptides, from large sequence databases. The implementation of the comparative class II peptide-binding studies to resolve the effects of polymorphic disease linked class II residues on peptide binding is also discussed in the chapter.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter summarizes the experimental findings and observations based on the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model and discusses the pathogenesis and the etiology of autoimmune diabetes. To elucidate the etiology of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), several animal models have been developed, including experimentally induced and spontaneously developing models. One is low-dose streptozocin-induced diabetes. A high dose of streptozocin destroys completely pancreatic $\beta$ cells but not $\alpha$ and $\delta$ cells, resulting in acute diabetes. Multiple injections of subdiabetogenic doses of streptozocin can also induce diabetes a few weeks after treatment. In the latter case, mononuclear infiltration in and around pancreatic islets is observed. IDDM in NOD mice is also immunologically mediated. IDDM in BB rats and NOD mice is very similar to the disease in humans. The availability of a large number of data and materials in mouse genetics and immunology has accelerated the use of NOD mice by diabetologists and immunologists who are interested in the pathogenesis of IDDM and the mechanism of autoimmunity. Several important findings obtained from studies on NOD mice have provided new insights into the immunological and genetic control of IDDM. The development of IDDM in NOD mice is divided roughly into two phases: initiation of autoimmune insulitis and promotion of islet destruction and overt diabetes.},

abstract = {Population studies have shown that among all the genetic factors linked with autoimmune disease development, MHC class II genes on chromosome 6 accounts for majority of familial clustering in the common autoimmune diseases. Despite the highly polymorphic nature of HLA class II genes, majority of autoimmune diseases are linked to a limited set of class II‐DR or ‐DQ alleles. Thus a more detailed study of these HLA‐DR and ‐DQ alleles were needed to understand their role in genetic predisposition and pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Although in vitro studies using class‐II restricted CD4 T cells and purified class II molecules have helped us in understanding some aspects of HLA class‐II association with disease, it is difficult to study the role of class II genes in vivo because of heterogeneity of human population, complexity of MHC, and strong linkage disequilibrium among different class II genes. To overcome this problem, we pioneered the generation of HLA‐class II transgenic mice to study role of these molecule in inflammatory disease. These HLA class II transgenic mice were used to develop novel in vivo disease model for common autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, insulin‐dependent diabetes mellitus, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease, autoimmune relapsing polychondritis, autoimmune myocarditis, thyroiditis, uveitis, as well as other inflammatory disease such as allergy, tuberculosis and toxic shock syndrome. As the T‐cell repertoire in these humanized HLA transgenic mice are shaped by human class II molecules, they show the same HLA restriction as humans, implicate potential triggering mechanism and autoantigens, and identify similar antigenic epitopes seen in human. This review describes the value of these humanized transgenic mice in deciphering role of HLA class II molecules in immunopathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter describes the main effects of vitamin D, and its activated form, on the beta cell, with direct implications for the pathogenesis and prevention of diabetes, focusing on type 1 diabetes. It also addresses the role of vitamin D and 1,25(OH)2D3 in the prevention of type 1 diabetes and its effects on the immune system of the animal models for the disease. Furthermore, it sheds light on emerging evidence of correlations between polymorphisms in the vitamin D metabolism and risk for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is present in almost every cell of the immune system, including macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), B cells, and T cells, allowing them to respond to the active ligand. Therefore, a physiological role for 1,25(OH)2D3 as a messenger or cytokine-like molecule in the immune system is reasonable, and so far many studies yielded beneficial results using active vitamin D to prevent and intervene in different autoimmune disease models including type 1 diabetes. Long-term intervention studies are, however, needed to demonstrate whether vitamin D plays a crucial role in the epidemic of diabetes and whether supplementing individuals will decrease their risk for diabetes. The vitamin D receptor is present in beta cells and in other tissues involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 and 2 diabetes (immune system, liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle). In vitro studies and studies in animal models suggest beneficial effects of supplemental vitamin D in diabetes, but in humans only epidemiological data are available and prospective studies are lacking. An overview of available evidence on the role of vitamin D in diabetes and glucose metabolism is given.},

There is a need for imaging tools that allow the monitoring of ongoing inflammatory disease as well as the response to therapy. We discuss new magnetic resonance imaging--based technologies that have been used to monitor inflammation and disease progression in animal models of type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Therapeutic strategies for these diseases include the transfer of immune cells, such as dendritic cells, with the aim of preventing or halting the disease course. We discuss several new MRI labeling techniques developed to allow tracking of immune cells in vivo. These include direct ex vivo labeling techniques as well as the genetic modification of cells to allow them to produce their own contrast agents. This is an area of intense recent research and can be expanded to other conditions such as cancer.},

abstract = {This paper assesses the quantitative resolution of qPCR using copy number variation (CNV) as a paradigm. An error model is developed for real-time qPCR data showing how the precision of CNV determination varies with the number of replicates. Using samples with varying numbers of X chromosomes, experimental data demonstrates that real-time qPCR can readily distinguish four copes from five copies, which corresponds to a 1.25-fold difference in relative quantity. Digital PCR is considered as an alternative form of qPCR. For digital PCR, an error model is shown that relates the precision of CNV determination to the number of reaction chambers. The quantitative capability of digital PCR is illustrated with an experiment distinguishing four and five copies of the human gene MRGPRX1. For either real-time qPCR or digital PCR, practical application of these models to achieve enhanced quantitative resolution requires use of a high throughput PCR platform that can simultaneously perform thousands of reactions. Comparing the two methods, real-time qPCR has the advantage of throughput and digital PCR has the advantage of simplicity in terms of the assumptions made for data analysis.},

There is a growing consensus that, in addition to the method used for detection, at least one additional technology should be employed for validation. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis, incorporating a normal (2N) copy number standard, is commonly used as a means of validating CNVs. Whereas it has previously been reported that formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) DNA samples can yield spurious CNV calls in real-time qPCR assays, here we report that sample degradation under standard laboratory storage conditions generates a significant increase in false-positive CNV results.

Exploiting a transgene encoding the human diphtheria toxin receptor, we punctually and specifically ablated Foxp3+ cells in the BCD2.5/NOD mouse model of autoimmune diabetes. Strikingly, overt disease developed within 3 days. The earliest detectable event was the activation of natural killer (NK) cells directly within the insulitic lesion, particularly the induction of Ifng gene expression within 7 hours of Treg cell ablation. Interferon-$\gamma$ had a strong impact on the gene-expression program of the local CD4+ T effector cell population, unleashing it to aggressively attack the islets, which was required for the development of diabetes. Thus, Treg cells regulate pancreatic autoimmunity in situ through control of a central innate immune system player, NK cells.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the role of epigenetics in immune disorders. The immune system enables the organism to resist infections and is composed of the innate or non-specific system and the adaptive or specific system. Aberrations in any part of it can lead to misdirected reactions resulting in autoimmunity where the immune system attack turns against the host tissues. Research has focused on elaborating the epigenetic regulation of the forkhead box P3---a transcriptional repressor and the master regulator of development and function of Treg cells. It has been shown that CpG motifs in the locus of Foxp3 are demethylated in Tregs in contrast to naive T cells. Furthermore, also histone modifications such as increased histone acetylation in the promoter of Foxp3 have been described in natural Tregs. Stimulation of Treg cells by ligation of TCR leads to the nuclear translocation of Foxp3 and its binding to promoters of proinflammatory IL-2 and INF-$\gamma$ inducing their deacetylation and silencing, as well as to promoters of GITR, CD25, and CTLA-4 increasing their acetylation and expression which is characteristic for the functional Tregs. It was shown that Foxp3 is optimally functional when in a complex with histone acetyltransferase Tip60 and histone deacetylase HDAC7. Summary Autoimmune disorders are characterized by self directed immune responses. For most of the autoimmune diseases the pathogenesis remains unclear. However, the contribution of epigenetic modifications is recognized in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and has recently emerged to be modified in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as well as few other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes, systemic sclerosis (SSc) and the immunodeficiency, centromeric instability and facial abnormalities (ICF syndrome). Thus, in this chapter we focus on the pattern of epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and gene expression regulating microRNA described in these immune disorders.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease, in which pancreatic beta cells are selectively destroyed. Innate immune response is also important in the development of T1D. Several studies have demonstrated that HLA class II alleles, DQ and DR influence T1D susceptibility. Specific class I and II alleles are non-randomly associated with each other on an extended haplotypes, the typing of which provide the best risk determinants of T1D. Studying the haplotype in different ethnic populations will enable us to identify the exact polymorphisms that can trigger T1D and to develop biological tools for protection. With the advent of numerous candidate markers, additional loci that influence susceptibility to T1D have been reported. Although different studies have suggested that various genetic variants increase the risk, large-scale association studies that examine many polymorphisms simultaneously are required to allow reliable prediction of the genetic risk. Not only the numbers of genetic markers we are applying, but also the accurate phenotyping is critical in the success of setting-up a best-fitting model for prediction. For a better phenotyping, multiple autoantibodies to islet cell antigens, which may arise even before the clinical onset have been known as the best surrogate markers of T1D. However, differences in genotypes between antibody-positive individuals and T1D patients may indicate genetic factors, which determine progression to clinical disease. The ability to detect those antibody-positive individuals who will progress to T1D is central to prevention program.},

abstract = {{\&}{\#}xa0;Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin alpha (LT-$\alpha$) are immunomodulators that have been hypothesized to contribute to susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Several polymorphisms in the TNF and LT-$\alpha$ loci have been extensively studied for T1D association, with conflicting reports. In this study, we examined two TNF variants and one LT-$\alpha$ variant for T1D association in 283 Caucasian, multiplex T1D families for which complete human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping data are available. Initially, association with T1D was seen for LT-$\alpha$ A1069G (intron A, p = 0.011, rs909253) and TNF G(−308)A (p {\&}lt; 1 × 10−5, rs1800629), but no association was observed for TNF G(−238)A (rs361525). After adjusting the data for linkage disequilibrium (LD) with DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes, however, only one polymorphism, TNF G(−238)A showed significant association with T1D (p {\&}lt; 0.006). When HLA-DR3 haplotypes were examined, the A allele of TNF G(−238)A was significantly overtransmitted to affected offspring (p {\&}lt; 0.009). Including HLA-B data in the analysis revealed that TNF (−238)A is present exclusively on DR3 haplotypes that also carry HLA-B18. Transmission proportion of B18-DR3 haplotypes did not differ between those with TNF (−238)A and those with TNF (−238)G. Thus, variation at TNF does not affect the T1D risk for B18-DR3 haplotypes, and the apparent association of TNF(−238)A with T1D may simply reflect its presence on a high-risk haplotype.},

However, it is frequently difficult to determine which of the many genes of the HLA complex are directly involved in the disease process. The main reasons for these difficulties are the complexity of associations where several HLA complex genes might be involved, and the strong linkage disequilibrium that exists between the genes in this complex. The latter phenomenon leads to secondary disease associations, or what has been called `hitchhiking polymorphisms'. Here, we give an overview of the complexity of HLA associations in autoimmune disease, focusing on type 1 diabetes and trying to answer the question: how many and which HLA genes are directly involved?},

abstract = {Summary The inhibitor of apoptosis protein survivin is a promising tumor-associated antigen specifically recognized by CD8+ cytotoxic effector T-lymphocytes (CTL). To improve current vaccines that aim to induce survivin-specific CTL, it is necessary to study the role of CD4+ T-helper (TH) and CD4+ T-regulatory (Treg) cells. Because both TH and Treg cells recognize antigens in the context of HLA-class II molecules, identification of HLA class II--associated peptide epitopes from survivin is required. Here, we analyzed T-cell responses against survivin using synthetic peptides predicted to serve as HLA-DR--restricted epitopes. Six peptides were shown to induce CD4+ T-cell responses, restricted by HLA-DR molecules. For one peptide epitope, SVN10, T-cell clones were demonstrated to be capable of recognizing naturally processed antigen. SVN10-specific T cells could be stimulated from the blood of healthy individuals and cancer patients with multiple HLA-DR genotypes. Thus the identified SVN10 epitope can be used to study the role of CD4+ TH and Treg cells in immune responses and possibly be included in a multivalent peptide vaccine against survivin.},

Virus was isolated from a woman at diagnosis of T1D (Tuvemo 1) and in addition, virus was isolated from her son at diagnosis of T1D at the same day (Tuvemo 2). None of the isolates could initially be serotyped by conventional methods. The Tuvemo 1 virus was genotyped and after sub-cultivation it was also serotyped as Coxsackievirus B5. The mother revealed antibodies against GAD65. The boy and the father both revealed a significant increase in neutralization antibody titre against two strains of CBV-4, clearly indicating a recent or ongoing EV infection. In addition, the brother showed such a titre rise against another CBV-4 strain (E2) and against a CBV-5 strain (4429). These results show that the whole family had a proven EV infection at the time of T1D diagnosis of the mother and the 10-years-old boy, indicating that the infection might cause or accelerate the T1D.},

In this study, we demonstrate that an anti-IL2 receptor Mab, M720, when administered at doses which are immunosuppressive in vivo rapidly elicits an anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibody response. The induced antibodies are capable of blocking M720 binding to its target, the IL2 receptor, in vitro. Such anti-Id when given in concert with M720 block the expected in vivo inhibitory effects in delayed type hypersensitivity. Thus, mice respond to therapeutic doses of Mab therapy with the formation of neutralizing anti-Id. As this response is similar to that observed in humans given xenogeneic Mab, this model may be useful to further our understanding of this form of therapy.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing $\beta$-cells of the islets of Langerhans. One still open question is where naive islet-reactive T cells encounter antigens and become stimulated. In this report we have re-examined the expression of MHC class II (MHCII) genes in human islets to further explore the possibility that non-professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) within islets contribute to autoimmunity. Since development of T1D has been linked to viral infections, we also studied ex-vivo MHCII expression in response to interferon-$\alpha$ (IFN$\alpha$) in islet tissue and in different APCs. The findings are: first, MHCII genes expression in human islets is linked with the expression of the class II transactivator isoform transcribed from the promoter IV, similar to that described in non-professional APCs. Second, there is IFN$\alpha$-mediated lineage-specific regulation of MHCII genes expression, seen as a decrease in the accumulation of MHCII transcripts in pancreatic islets opposite to an increase in dendritic cells and B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. Third, there is allele-specific regulation of the HLA-DQA1 gene by IFN$\alpha$ in islet tissue. These findings may begin to explain the molecular events that create favorable conditions for organ-specific autoimmunity and explain the incomplete penetrance of T1D susceptibility alleles.},

abstract = {It has recently been shown that the T-cell mediated immune responses to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) play an important role in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in NOD mice. However, specific epitopes responsible for eliciting these responses remain unresolved. In this study, the T-cell epitopes involved in GAD-specific immune responses in NOD mice were characterized. By priming NOD mice with GAD65, three new GAD65 epitopes (GAD65 78--97, GAD65 202--221, GAD65 217--236) distinct from those previously reported were found. Furthermore, our investigations into the fine determinant specificity of GAD67 revealed two additional GAD67-specific peptide epitopes (GAD67 28--47, GAD67 42--61). Two of the GAD65 epitopes (GAD65 202--221 and GAD65 217--236) are shared between GAD65 and GAD67. Spontaneous immune responses to these peptides were found in pre-diabetic and diabetic mice and differential patterns of responses to these peptides were observed depending on the age of the mice, disease status, or if the mice were protected from diabetes by adjuvant immunotherapy. Characterization of these new epitopes will help in the elucidation of autoimmune responses to GAD in IDDM.},

Interaction between activated lymphocytes and endothelial cells in the islets is the hallmark of the homing process. Initial adhesion, firm adhesion and diapedesis of lymphocytes are the three crucial steps involved in the homing process. Cell-surface receptors including integrins, selectins and hyaluronate receptor CD44 mediate the initial steps of homing. Diapedesis relies on a series of proteolytic events mediated by matrix metalloproteinases. Here, molecular mechanisms governing transendothelial migration of the diabetogenic effector cells are discussed and resulting pharmacological strategies are considered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Oxidative stress is a common stress encountered by living organisms and is due to an imbalance between intracellular reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) and cellular antioxidant defence. To defend themselves against ROS/RNS, bacteria possess a subsystem of detoxification enzymes, which are classified with regard to their substrates. To identify such enzymes in prokaryotic genomes, different approaches based on similarity, enzyme profiles or patterns exist. Unfortunately, several problems persist in the annotation, classification and naming of these enzymes due mainly to some erroneous entries in databases, mistake propagation, absence of updating and disparity in function description.

DESCRIPTION:In order to improve the current annotation of oxidative stress subsystems, an innovative platform named OxyGene has been developed. It integrates an original database called OxyDB, holding thoroughly tested anchor-based signatures associated to subfamilies of oxidative stress enzymes, and a new anchor-driven annotator, for ab initio detection of ROS/RNS response genes. All complete Bacterial and Archaeal genomes have been re-annotated, and the results stored in the OxyGene repository can be interrogated via a Graphical User Interface.

CONCLUSION:OxyGene enables the exploration and comparative analysis of enzymes belonging to 37 detoxification subclasses in 664 microbial genomes. It proposes a new classification that improves both the ontology and the annotation of the detoxification subsystems in prokaryotic whole genomes, while discovering new ORFs and attributing precise function to hypothetical annotated proteins. OxyGene is freely available at: http://www.umr6026.univ-rennes1.fr/english/home/research/basic/software.},

The increase in MIOX enzyme activity is in proportion to serum glucose concentrations and may be responsible for the MI depletion found in the diabetic complications. The aim was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MIOX gene are associated with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) and its complications. Four hundred thirty Caucasian patients with T1D were recruited: 172 patients had diabetic nephropathy, 140 had diabetic retinopathy/neuropathy, 118 patients had diabetes for ≥20 years without microvascular complications and 224 were normal controls. Three SNPs, rs761745 (C/T), and rs2232873 (A/G) in the promoter and rs1055271 (C/G) in the 3′-untranslated were genotyped commercially. The frequencies of the CC genotype (0.36 vs. 0.44; P=.034) and C allele (0.60 vs. 0.68; P=.011) of rs761745 were significantly lower in patients with T1D compared with normal controls. Patients with T1D had a decreased frequency of the combination genotypes of CC (rs761745), GG (rs2232873) and GC (rs1055271) compared with the normal controls (0.13 vs. 0.22, P=.0027, Pc=0.014). The haplotypes with C/G/G and C/G/C were less common in patients with T1D compared to normal controls (0.59 vs. 0.70, P=.021) and the haplotypes with T/G/C and T/G/G ware more common in patients with T1D compared to normal controls (0.37 vs. 0.26; P=.021). In summary, our results demonstrated that the polymorphism (rs761745) in the promoter region of MIOX gene may be associated with the development of T1D in our studied population.},

In untreated female NOD mice, diabetes developed starting at 13{\&}{\#}xa0;weeks and reached 68% by 37{\&}{\#}xa0;weeks.

Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests in 43{\&}{\#}xa0;week-old ALS-treated, diabetes-free mice showed a normal pattern. Co-adoptive transfer of lymphoid cells prepared from ALS-treated diabetes-free mice together with splenocytes from overtly diabetic NOD mice resulted in marked delay in diabetes onset in NOD.SCID mice, suggesting the presence of autoimmune regulatory cells in ALS-treated mice. Autoimmune regulatory cells were CD4+CD25+, but not CD4+CD25−, T cells. Thus, treatment of euglycemic individuals who already show signs of autoimmune diabetes with a short course of polyclonal anti-T cell antibody may effectively prevent onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus.},

Do pairwise or multimarker methods maximize efficiency and power? To what extent is power compromised when tags are selected from an incomplete resource such as HapMap? We addressed these questions using genotype data from the HapMap ENCODE project, association studies simulated under a realistic disease model, and empirical correction for multiple hypothesis testing. We demonstrate a haplotype-based tagging method that uniformly outperforms single-marker tests and methods for prioritization that markedly increase tagging efficiency. Examining all observed haplotypes for association, rather than just those that are proxies for known SNPs, increases power to detect rare causal alleles, at the cost of reduced power to detect common causal alleles. Power is robust to the completeness of the reference panel from which tags are selected. These findings have implications for prioritizing tag SNPs and interpreting association studies.},

We aimed to clarify the contribution of AITD on the susceptibility and resistance of the HLA subtype to autoimmune T1D in the Japanese population. Methods The frequency of the HLA DR-DQ haplotype was compared between 56 autoimmune T1D patients with AITD and 71 autoimmune T1D patients without AITD, and control subjects. Results The frequencies of DRB1*0405-DQB1*0401, DRB1*0802-DQB1*0302, and DRB1*0901-DQB1*0303 haplotypes were significantly higher in T1D patients with AITD than in control subjects. The frequencies of DRB1*0101-DQB1*0501, DRB1*0901-DQB1*0303, and DRB1*1302-DQB1*0604 haplotypes were significantly higher in T1D patients without AITD than in control subjects. The frequencies of DRB1*1101-DQB1*0301 and DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 haplotypes were significantly lower in T1D patients with or without AITD than in control subjects. Conclusions Our results suggest that the susceptibility of the HLA subtype to autoimmune T1D differs between T1D with AITD and T1D without AITD, whereas there is no difference between the two groups with regard to HLA subtypes that confer protection against autoimmune T1D.},

It is now clearly established that commensals are not equal in their capacity to trigger control regulatory or effector responses, however, the molecular basis of these differences has only recently begun to be explored. This review will discuss recent findings evaluating how commensals shape both effector and regulatory responses at steady state and during infections and the consequence of this effect on local and systemic protective and inflammatory responses.},

abstract = {For many complex traits, genetic variants have been found associated. However, it is still mostly unclear through which downstream mechanism these variants cause these phenotypes. Knowledge of these intermediate steps is crucial to understand pathogenesis, while also providing leads for potential pharmacological intervention. Here we relied upon natural human genetic variation to identify effects of these variants on trans-gene expression (expression quantitative trait locus mapping, eQTL) in whole peripheral blood from 1,469 unrelated individuals. We looked at 1,167 published trait- or disease-associated SNPs and observed trans-eQTL effects on 113 different genes, of which we replicated 46 in monocytes of 1,490 different individuals and 18 in a smaller dataset that comprised subcutaneous adipose, visceral adipose, liver tissue, and muscle tissue. HLA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were 10-fold enriched for trans-eQTLs: 48% of the trans-acting SNPs map within the HLA, including ulcerative colitis susceptibility variants that affect plausible candidate genes AOAH and TRBV18 in trans. We identified 18 pairs of unlinked SNPs associated with the same phenotype and affecting expression of the same trans-gene (21 times more than expected, P<10(-16)). This was particularly pronounced for mean platelet volume (MPV): Two independent SNPs significantly affect the well-known blood coagulation genes GP9 and F13A1 but also C19orf33, SAMD14, VCL, and GNG11. Several of these SNPs have a substantially higher effect on the downstream trans-genes than on the eventual phenotypes, supporting the concept that the effects of these SNPs on expression seems to be much less multifactorial. Therefore, these trans-eQTLs could well represent some of the intermediate genes that connect genetic variants with their eventual complex phenotypic outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The wide availability of genome-scale data for several organisms has stimulated interest in computational approaches to gene function prediction. Diverse machine learning methods have been applied to unicellular organisms with some success, but few have been extensively tested on higher level, multicellular organisms. A recent mouse function prediction project (MouseFunc) brought together nine bioinformatics teams applying a diverse array of methodologies to mount the first large-scale effort to predict gene function in the laboratory mouse.

RESULTS:In this paper, we describe our contribution to this project, an ensemble framework based on the support vector machine that integrates diverse datasets in the context of the Gene Ontology hierarchy. We carry out a detailed analysis of the performance of our ensemble and provide insights into which methods work best under a variety of prediction scenarios. In addition, we applied our method to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have experimentally confirmed functions for a novel mitochondrial protein.

CONCLUSION:Our method consistently performs among the top methods in the MouseFunc evaluation. Furthermore, it exhibits good classification performance across a variety of cellular processes and functions in both a multicellular organism and a unicellular organism, indicating its ability to discover novel biology in diverse settings.},

abstract = {Rice is a staple food for one-half the world's population and a model for other monocotyledonous species. Thus, efficient approaches for identifying key genes controlling simple or complex traits in rice have important biological, agricultural, and economic consequences. Here, we report on the construction of RiceNet, an experimentally tested genome-scale gene network for a monocotyledonous species. Many different datasets, derived from five different organisms including plants, animals, yeast, and humans, were evaluated, and 24 of the most useful were integrated into a statistical framework that allowed for the prediction of functional linkages between pairs of genes. Genes could be linked to traits by using guilt-by-association, predicting gene attributes on the basis of network neighbors. We applied RiceNet to an important agronomic trait, the biotic stress response. Using network guilt-by-association followed by focused protein-protein interaction assays, we identified and validated, in planta, two positive regulators, LOC_Os01g70580 (now Regulator of XA21; ROX1) and LOC_Os02g21510 (ROX2), and one negative regulator, LOC_Os06g12530 (ROX3). These proteins control resistance mediated by rice XA21, a pattern recognition receptor. We also showed that RiceNet can accurately predict gene function in another major monocotyledonous crop species, maize. RiceNet thus enables the identification of genes regulating important crop traits, facilitating engineering of pathways critical to crop productivity.},

abstract = {Many research projects in cell biology now use flow cytometry for analysis or for isolation of specific cell types. In such studies, cell viability is obviously a crucial issue. However, many studies appear to rely upon light-scattering characteristics to identify and gate out non-viable cells, despite the fact that reliable identification of such cells can only be achieved through staining with impermeable fluorescent nuclear dyes such as propidium iodide or 7-amino actinomycin. In this paper we apply mathematical analysis to the theoretical problem of quantifying cell sub-populations labeled with two or more fluorescent markers, comparing situations in which dead cells have been identified with those in which cell viability has not been assessed. We demonstrate that in all cases in which dead cells are present within the population, percentages of live sub-populations in different subsets are mis-estimated. In cases where the pattern of marker expression differs greatly between live and dead cells, or where the proportion of dead cells is high, this mis-estimation will be aggravated; the subsets pattern will therefore be biased in a population selected only on the basis of light-scatter behavior. The importance of accurately detecting and gating out dead cells is illustrated by an experimental example accompanying the mathematical analysis. To conclude, identification of dead cells by means of viability stains should be an absolute routine in practical flow cytometry, so as to avoid mis-estimation in sorting or analysis.},

abstract = {Various sources of variability in flow cytometric determination of cell concentration have previously been investigated with respect to andrologic applications. Although common aspects related to the variation between samples, variation between operators, and accuracy have been extensively studied, specific sources of false-count estimation have found less attention. In particular, a major and well-recognized source of misestimation of cell counts (i.e., contamination of the sample by non-sperm particles) has not to date been characterized in detail. We show here by means of original mathematical research that not only the cell counts but also the percentages of cells expressing different fluorescence patterns are affected by the presence of alien particles often neglected in studies involving flow cytometric characterization. We demonstrate that there is a systematic overestimation in the proportion of unstained (viable) cells detected by flow cytometry in cases where the non-sperm particles are not excluded from analysis by additional identification other than light-scatter characteristics. Moreover, we provide an exact mathematical estimate for the magnitude of this overestimation, and we discuss the consequences for diagnostic applications and studies on sperm physiology, specifically for studies on sperm capacitation and evaluation of cryopreserved semen. Finally, equations are derived for the correction of the flow cytometric values for use in practical applications.},

abstract = {The ontogenic variation of beta cell function and its relationship with the degree of islet damage and levels of autoantibodies have been studied in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. We conducted in vivo first phase insulin release (FPIR) in response to intravenous glucose and studied its correlation with the degree of insulitis, islet cell antibody (ICA) and insulin autoantibody (IAA) levels in female NOD mice cross-sectionally at days 40 (n = 19), 90 (n = 21), 150--160 (n = 21) and day 250 (n = 20). The mean $\pm$ SEM FPIR values showed an age-related decline from day 40 (46.2 $\pm$ 5.3 $\mu$U/ml) to day 150--160 (17.8 $\pm$ 2.5 $\mu$U/ml) and then doubled at day 250 (34.5 $\pm$ 5 $\mu$U/ml), while the mean $\pm$ SEM insulitis scores increased progressively until day 150--160 (61.7 $\pm$ 6.1%) and then declined slightly at day 250 to 50.2 $\pm$ 6.2%. In female NOD mice with spontaneous diabetes (n = 4) and streptozotocin-induced diabetic Swiss mice (n = 5) FPIR was either absent or greatly attenuated. A statistically significant inverse correlation between FPIR and insulitis was found among NOD mice at days 90 (P = 0.02; r = −0.52) and 150--160 (P = 0.03; r = −0.48). However, no statistically significant correlation was observed at days 40 and 250. Morphometric techniques applied to day 150--160 pancreatic sections showed a statistically significant negative correlation between insulitis and beta cell number per unit area of islet tissue (P = 0.0001; r = −0.75). At this age some islet beta cells showed different intensities of staining by immunofluorescence. ICA or IAA levels did not show any correlation with insulitis or FPIR at the various age groups. The present data showing good correlation between FPIR values and insulitis at some age groups and not at others may be due to the relative imprecision of the in vivo IVGTT test or may indicate true beta cell pathogenesis during autoimmune destruction. These results shed further insights into the physiological basis for the use of the FPIR test for predicting insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in humans.},

Pancreata of TGF-$\beta$ transgenic mice were roughly one twentieth of the size of pancreata of wild-type NOD mice and showed small clusters of micro-islets rather than normal adult islets. However, these islets produced sufficient levels of insulin to maintain normal glucose levels and mice were protected from the diabetes, which developed in their negative littermates. A massive fibrosis was seen in the transgenic pancreata that was accompanied with infiltration of mononuclear cells that decreased with age. Interestingly, these mice showed normal anti-islet immune response in their spleens and remained susceptible to adoptive transfer of IDDM by mature cloned CD8 effector cells. TUNEL assays revealed increased apoptosis of invading cells when compared to non-transgenic NOD mice. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-$\beta$ protects islets by a local event.},

In AIDS the basic defect would be the human specific inability to distinguish between the amino acid sequence of neuroleukin and peptides derived from the gp 120 envelope protein of HIV, resulting in a slowly progressing failure of the CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity. In IDDM the postulated HLA class II-dependent hypersensitivity to immunological noise could predispose to random contacts between cells with a different signalling language. In the ensuing dialogue neuroleukin secreted by T cells would imply a continuous demand for insulin secretion to pancreatic beta cells resulting in diabetes. This hypothesis does not contradict with the provocative ideas proposed by Duesberg concerning the relationships between HIV and AIDS (24) and the known data on the genesis of IDDM.},

Genotyping of the BTNL2 gene rs2076530 polymorphism was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction technology, using the TaqMan 5′-allele discrimination assay. We observed statistically significant differences in the distribution of BTNL2rs2076530 alleles between patients with T1D, RA, and SLE and healthy controls (p = 0.0035, 0.000003, and 0.00002, respectively), but in two divergent ways: the G allele was associated with T1D and RA, and the A allele was associated with SLE. However, the polymorphism exhibited strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA DQB1--DRB1 haplotypes previously identified as predisposing to the diseases. When the BTNL2 polymorphism was tested conditional on HLA DQB1--DRB1haplotypes, the BTNL2 effect was no longer significant in all three study populations. The BTNL2 rs2076530 polymorphism is associated with T1D, RA, and SLE because of its strong linkage disequalibrium with predisposing HLA DQB1--DRB1 haplotypes in Caucasian populations.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. It was thus logical to attempt preventing or stopping the progression of the disease by immunotherapy. Following the strategies used in organ transplantation, the first trials in the 80{\&}{\#}xa0;s used cyclosporin in patients presenting recently diagnosed Type 1 diabetes. The effect was spectacular but waned when the treatment was stopped as the effect was non antigen-specific. Going back from bed to bench-side major efforts were then devoted to device strategies allowing induction or restoration of self-tolerance. Two major approaches provided encouraging results when used in spontaneous models of autoimmune diabetes that are the use of $\beta$-cell autoantigens and of monoclonal antibodies to CD3. Based on these results academic phase II trials and subsequently pharmaceutically driven phase III trials were launched. Results are now available and when critically analyzed in the frame of these last three decades they provide support to the possibility of making step by step immunotherapy available to all new onset diabetic patients with a hope of inducing long-term remission of the disease if the treatment is started sufficiently early, immediately after diagnosis.},

Recently, an extensive effort has been devoted to design clinical trials with Tregs in T cell-mediated diseases (such as autoimmune diseases or transplantation). Theoretically, this approach can be used also in patients with autoimmunity (e.g., type 1 diabetes) undergoing allogeneic transplantation (e.g., pancreatic islet transplant). However, in this latter case Tregs must control two distinct effector immune responses: a pre-existing response towards self-antigens and a de novo response induced by the newly transplanted allogeneic cells. In this review we summarize results supporting the use of Tregs in controlling either autoimmunity or allo-transplantation. We also provide our view on how Treg therapy can achieve the final goal of immunological tolerance in the extremely challenging clinical setting of type 1 diabetic subjects transplanted with allogeneic islets.},

In this study we used mice transgenic to HLA DQ8 and HLA-DQ6 to elucidate the T cell determinants on a putative islet cell target antigen, insulin. These mice do not express endogenous mouse class II heterodimers on cell surface. Using overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the complete sequence of human pre-proinsulin, we identified the sequences recognized by T cells in DQ8 transgenic mice and compared these to those in DQ6 transgenic mice. We observed a differential pattern of recognition of epitopes on human pre-proinsulin (HPI) polypeptide presented by the HLA DQ8 allele as compared to HLA DQ6. The sequences 1-24 and 44-63 were immunodominant in DQ8 transgenic mice while DQ6 transgenic mice primarily recognized sequences 14-33 and 74-93 of HPI. We found that the immune response generated in HLA DQ8 transgenic mice against HPI 1-24 cross-reacted to the mouse pre-proinsulin sequence 1-24. The T cell response were specifically inhibited using anti- CD4 and anti-DQ8 monoclonal antibodies. This cross-recognition of self sequences raises the possibility of modulation of experimental diabetes using this peptide.},

In recent years, the concept of immune regulation/suppression has been firmly established, and both natural and induced regulatory cells play vital roles in protection from autoimmune disease. Recent work has revealed the diverse nature of regulatory CD4+ T (Treg) cells and the molecules involved in their function. Innate and adaptive responses to infection are able to override the suppressive properties of such regulatory cells, whereas several reports point to deficiencies in regulatory cell function in autoimmune disease. Protocols have been developed that allow the expansion of Treg cells in vitro and their antigen-specific induction in vivo. A full understanding of Treg differentiation and function will facilitate the development of improved strategies for prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases.},

NOD mice were immunized with a human IgM mAb carrying the 16/6 idiotype (MIV-7) or with control human IgM. The mice were bled monthly and tested for SLE-associated autoantibodies in the serum and for the presence of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, proteinuria and immunoglobulin deposits in the kidneys. The development of diabetes was determined by a blood glucose level exceeding 15{\&}{\#}xa0;mM on two consecutive weekly determinations and by the presence of insulitis in the pancreas. The NOD mice immunized with MIV-7 developed high and persistent levels of autoantibodies, including anti-DNA, anti-histones and anti-cardiolipin, untreated mice and those immunized with normal human IgM did not produce these autoantibodies. The MIV-7-immunized mice also manifested an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and significant proteinuria, as well as deposits of Ig in their kidney glomeruli. Thus, NOD mice immunized with MIV-7 developed both autoantibodies and clinical features of SLE. The MIV-7-treated mice, however, showed a significantly lower incidence of IDDM (25%vs . 90%, P{\&}lt;0.003), accompanied by amelioration of the insulitis. The present study indicates that the induction of SLE by idiotypic immunization can protect NOD mice from developing IDDM, pointing to the importance of immune dysregulation in shift from one autoimmune disease to another.},

Whether eliminating islet autoantibody transmission in utero, or postnatally (through milk), prevented T1D is unknown. Herein, we show that fostering newborn NOD mice on B-cell deficient NOD.Ig$\mu$−/− dams does not prevent T1D, demonstrating that postnatally transmitted islet autoantibodies are not required for disease pathogenesis. Additionally, NOD.Ig$\mu$−/− mice reared on NOD dams did not develop T1D, indicating that autoantibody transmission to B-cell deficient NOD neonates is insufficient to trigger T1D. Interestingly, newborn NOD mice that were reared by ICR (but not NOD or C57BL/6) dams had reduced T1D incidence, although not as reduced as that reported after embryo transfer to ICR mice, suggesting that both prenatal and postnatal factors contribute to the observed reduction in T1D incidence. Thus, NOD mice have different risks for developing T1D depending on the strain of their foster mother, and both prenatal and postnatal maternal factors, other than islet autoantibodies, influence their T1D incidence. The results may be relevant for understanding the increasing incidence of T1D and designing interventions.},

The levels of glucose-stimulated insulin release from NOD mouse islets increased after tissue culture, whereas it remained unchanged in NMRI mouse islets. Overall changes in islet insulin secretion were accompanied by similar changes in IAPP secretion. Acute after isolation, islets from NMRI mice displayed a reduced IAPP/insulin secretion ratio in response to the stimulation, which could reflect a destabilized hormone release. When the NOD mouse islets at 6--9 weeks of age were exposed to secretory stimuli the molar ratio of IAPP/insulin secretion declined. At a later stage of advanced insulitis (12--15 weeks) also the basal IAPP/insulin secretory ratio at low glucose tended to decline. If extrapolated to the early prediabetic phase of human IDDM, this would mean that a relative hypersecretion of insulin in relation to IAPP might occur, due to an increased secretory demand for insulin or due to an intrinsic change in the biology of the secretory cells.},

abstract = {Summary Acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a major cause of mortality in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), for which administration of FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells has been proposed as a therapy. However, the phenotypic stability of Treg cells is controversial, and STAT3-dependent cytokines can inhibit FoxP3 expression. We assessed whether the elimination of STAT3 in T cells could limit the severity of GvHD. We found STAT3 limited FoxP3+ Treg cell numbers following allogeneic BMT by two pathways: instability of natural Treg (nTreg) cells and inhibition of induced Treg (iTreg) cell polarization from naive CD4+ T cells. Deletion of STAT3 within only the nTreg cell population was not sufficient to protect against lethal GvHD. In contrast, transfer of STAT3-deficient naive CD4+ T cells increased FoxP3+ Treg cells post-BMT and prevented lethality, suggesting that the consequence of STAT3 signaling may be greater for iTreg rather than nTreg cells during GvHD.},

abstract = {Insulin-dependent diabetes (IDD) in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is believed to result from the specific autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. The frequency of diabetes in the NOD mouse is sex-dependent, with approximately 90% of females and 40% of males developing clinical diabetes by 40 weeks of age. Recently, attention has focused on determining possible mechanisms for beta cell destruction. One potential mechanism is the toxic effect of free oxygen radicals produced as a result of the influx of inflammatory cells into the pancreas. A deficiency in available antioxidant enzymes could form a basis for diabetes susceptibility. To test the feasibility of this idea, we have compared the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase in isolated islets, pancreas, and other tissues of age- and sex-matched NOD, BALB/c, C57BL/10, and B10·GD mice. Enzyme profiles revealed that female NOD mice do not differ significantly in antioxidant enzyme activity from females of the other inbred strains. However, antioxidant enzyme activity in females was generally lower than in males regardless of mouse strain. While isolated islet cells exhibited somewhat lower levels of enzyme activity than other tissues, the islets of NOD mice proved to be no more deficient than those of BALB/c mice. Therefore, it is unlikely that any toxic effect of free oxygen radicals on the beta cells of NOD mice results directly or solely from an antioxidant enzyme deficiency. Nevertheless, one possible explanation for the lower incidence of diabetes in NOD males versus females may be the inherently higher male antioxidant enzyme activities.},

Hyperexpression of Class I MHC molecules by the endocrine cells of insulin-containing islets is a feature unique to type 1 diabetes
 Indeed, hyperexpression of class I MHC by islet endocrine cells has now been established as a characteristic feature of inflamed human islets which retain residual $\beta$-cells, in type 1 diabetes

Class I and II MHC antigen expression within human pancreas

Normally, pancreatic endocrine cells do not express Class II MHC molecules and they only weakly express Class I MHC [34]. By contrast, class I expression is observed on endothelial and nerve cells in normal pancreas [35] and Class II expression is seen on endothelial cells and occasional duct cells in this tissue [35]. The exocrine tissue does not normally express MHC Class II and is, at best, only weakly positive for MHC Class I.

Although the expression levels vary, all nucleated cells within the body use Class I MHC molecules to present antigen to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Such antigens are derived from peptides produced by intracellular degradation of target molecules and, by this means, a cell can present to the immune system any marker indicative of abnormal function or infection (for example by a virus). In contrast, CD4+ T cells recognise antigen only in the context of Class II MHC, which is normally expressed exclusively on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In this case, the antigen is usually derived from the breakdown of proteins that the APCs have endocytosed from their environment. However, irrespective of the source of any given antigen, in order for either a CD4+ T or CD8+T cell to become fully activated in response to that antigen, a second signal emanating from the activation of either CD80 or CD86 present on the APC, is also required. This signal is transduced via CD28 present on T cells and, in order for this to happen, the APC and T cell must be brought into close physical proximity; a process mediated by a variety of adhesion molecules. Hence, it is important to consider the role of MHC antigens and cell adhesion molecules in the process of islet inflammation.





Hyperexpression of Class I MHC by the islets of a recent-onset type 1 diabetic patient was first described by Bottazzo et al. in 1985 [19]. This was later confirmed in a larger cohort by Foulis et al. [35], who showed that this phenomenon was confined to insulin-containing islets. Indeed, hyperexpression of class I MHC by islet endocrine cells has now been established as a characteristic feature of inflamed human islets which retain residual $\beta$-cells, in type 1 diabetes [18, 20, 36--38]. For example, in a study of pancreas samples from 31 type 1 diabetes patients, all of which contained some residual $\beta$-cells, 92% of ICIs (compared with only 1% of IDIs) were found to hyperexpress Class I MHC [35]. Interestingly, however, the hyperexpression was not restricted solely to $\beta$-cells since all of the endocrine cells within the positive islets hyperexpressed Class I MHC [35].

 It appears, therefore, that when $\alpha$ and $\delta$ cells are in the proximity of $\beta$-cells in inflamed islets of type 1 diabetes patients, they also hyperexpress Class I MHC. However, in the case of an IDI, where no $\beta$-cells are present, this hyperexpression ceases [35]. As a consequence, it has been hypothesised that a factor released from $\beta$-cells must be responsible for the hyperexpression of Class I MHC in type 1 diabetes. Equivalent hyperexpression of Class I MHC within islets was not observed in any of 95 normal controls or in various other pancreatic diseases (such as cystic fibrosis, type 2 diabetes or chronic pancreatitis) [35].


The hyperexpression of Class I MHC by islet endocrine cells in human type 1 diabetes appears to precede insulitis. Thus, Bottazzo et al., reported that islets hyperexpressed Class I MHC irrespective of the presence of a lymphocytic infiltrate in a recent-onset patient they examined [19]. Additionally, a more detailed analysis of 23 recent-onset type 1 diabetes cases demonstrated that, while insulitis was always accompanied by hyperexpression of Class I MHC within the islets, approximately half of the islets that hyperexpressed Class I MHC were not inflamed [35]. This was further confirmed in later studies [18, 20, 36]. Of interest, the expression of Class I MHC was also increased on capillary endothelium and ductal epithelium near inflamed human islets in type 1 diabetes, when compared to normal controls [18, 20] and this may therefore actively encourage the recruitment of activated CD8+ T cells. 

The finding that the magnitude and efficiency of CD8+ T cell proliferation, adhesion and transmigration is greatly enhanced when endothelial cells isolated from NOD mice are induced to express high levels of Class I MHC supports this possibility [39].

Importantly, the temporal profile of increased MHC class I expression in human type 1 diabetes, appears to be different from that seen in certain mouse models [40, 41]. 

In these animals, the release of IFN$\gamma$ from infiltrating immune cells (Th1 cells) may contribute to the hyperexpression of Class I MHC on $\beta$-cells [40, 41] implying that MHC class I hyperexpression follows from islet inflammation. 

By contrast, in humans, insulitis is never observed in the absence of Class I MHC hyperexpression.

Aberrant expression of Class II MHC molecules on beta cells in type 1 diabetes

Class II MHC antigens have been shown to be aberrantly expressed in the pancreas in type 1 diabetes [18--20, 35, 42, 43] where their presence is confined to ICIs [19, 20, 35, 42]. However, unlike Class I MHC, which is hyperexpressed by all of the endocrine cells within any given affected islet, class II MHC expression is restricted solely to the $\beta$-cells. Additionally, however, hyperexpression of class II MHC can also sometimes be observed on endothelial cells in the vicinity of inflamed islets [19, 20, 35, 42]. 

No aberrant MHC class II expression was seen on $\beta$-cells in other diseases affecting the pancreas (including type 2 diabetes, cystic fibrosis or chronic pancreatitis) [42]. There is some debate about the incidence of aberrant Class II MHC expression in $\beta$-cells in human type 1 diabetes, as it is very variable between studies with the incidence ranging from fewer than 1% to almost 14% of ICIs [18--20, 35, 42]. One possible explanation for these differences could be the use of a single islet section to determine whether any given islet has aberrant Class II MHC expression (and insulitis). For example, when data from serial sections was reconstructed to examine the `whole' islet, it was revealed that these values can be seriously underestimated. Application of this type of analysis to three cases generated a different result when only a single section was studied (12% of islets were reported to be inflamed and 26% of ICIs showed aberrant MHC class II expression) compared to when the data were compiled from serial sections (44% of ICIs were then scored as inflamed and 67% of ICI displayed aberrant Class II MHC expression on endocrine cells [35]). The hyperexpression of Class I MHC however, was shown to be accurately estimated from a single section [35]. Interestingly, the aberrant expression of Class II MHC was only observed in islets, which also had hyperexpression of Class I MHC [35], and insulitis was only observed in approximately half of the islets having evidence of aberrant Class II MHC expression [35]. In summary therefore, the aberrant expression of Class II MHC appears to be focal in nature within any given islet and is restricted to a minority of insulin-containing $\beta$-cells [19, 35, 42]. It occurs after hyperexpression of MHC class I within a given islet, but can, at least in some cases, precede insulitis [35].

Expression of adhesion molecules and co-stimulatory molecules in type 1 diabetes---the contribution of the endothelium
Several groups have observed increased levels of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 on vascular endothelial cells and ductal epithelium in the vicinity of the inflamed islets of recent-onset type 1 patients [18, 20, 44]. In contrast vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, LFA3 and E-selectin were absent [18, 44]. ICAM-1 interacts with LFA1 present on immune cells and, in the context of T cells, it can strengthen the TCR-MHC signalling synapse thereby, promoting downstream signal transduction. An examination of islets from type 1 diabetes patients for expression of the co-stimulatory molecules, CD80 and CD86 (which are required for full activation of T cells), revealed that neither was present on endocrine cells. However, since this result was obtained using biopsy material, additional studies should probably be conducted to verify this conclusion in larger pancreatic tissue sections. This issue is important because, in the case of ``professional'' antigen-presenting cells, expression of MHC class II antigens in the absence of either CD80 or CD86 can induce tolerance rather than T cell activation. In islets with evidence of insulitis, the expression of CD80 and CD86 has been observed on a subset of T cells [43] and, interestingly, functional CD86 expression has also been observed on islet endothelial cells present within freshly isolated human islets [45]. Thus the components required to propagate the second signal required for full T cell activation can be detected within the islet milieu, even if they are not all present on beta cells themselves. This finding, coupled with the enhanced Class I and II MHC expression observed in endothelial cells in and around inflamed islets, demonstrates that the vascular endothelium expresses molecules necessary for antigen presentation, activation and the efficient adhesion of antigen specific T cells.

Interferons as possible mediators of the hyperexpression of Class I MHC and aberrant expression of Class II MHC antigens in type 1 diabetes patients


As noted previously, it has been argued that $\beta$-cells might, themselves, represent the source of the signal that results in the hyperexpression of Class I MHC antigens within islets. Candidate molecules that might propagate this signal include interferon-alpha (IFN$\alpha$) and interferon-$\beta$ (IFN$\beta$), type 1 IFNs that can each induce the hyperexpression of Class I MHC on isolated islet endocrine cells cultured in vitro [46]. In keeping with this, IFN$\alpha$ expression was found in the islets of 33of 34 recent-onset type 1 diabetes patients examined by immunohistochemistry, and its expression was strongly correlated with hyperexpression of Class I MHC in these islets [47]. Others have confirmed the presence of IFN$\alpha$ in islets present on pancreatic sections [23], have shown the presence of IFN$\alpha$ mRNA by RT-PCR in islets isolated from recent-onset type 1 diabetes cases [18, 48] and have reported an increase in plasma IFN$\alpha$ levels in the circulation of patients with type 1 diabetes [49]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the expression of IFN$\beta$ in the pancreas of type 1 diabetes patients has not been examined to date.
Further support for a role of IFN$\alpha$ in the immunopathology of type 1 diabetes comes from the finding that isolated human islets treated with IFN$\alpha$ are induced to express a series of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) [50] such as the chemokine CXCL10 [38, 51] (which is involved in the recruitment of activated T cells) and the anti-viral proteins, protein kinase R (PKR) [52, 53], 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) [50, 53] and Mda5 (IFIH1) [50]. Interestingly, the expression of CXCL10 and PKR is enhanced in recent-onset type 1 diabetic islets [38, 51, 52], and Mda5 has recently been associated with type 1 diabetes in a genome-wide association scan (GWAS) [54]. Moreover, rare polymorphic variants of the Mda5 gene (IFIH1) can protect against type 1 diabetes in otherwise genetically susceptible individuals [55].
On the basis of in vitro studies, IFN$\gamma$ has been reported to upregulate Class I MHC expression on isolated $\beta$-cells and $\beta$-cell lines [46, 56] to a greater extent than either IFN$\alpha$ or IFN$\beta$. Other cytokines released from infiltrating immune cells, such as TNF$\alpha$, have also been shown to upregulate Class I MHC in vitro. When combined together, IFN$\gamma$ and TNF$\alpha$ synergise to induce still greater expression [57, 58]. However, in humans, it appears that IFN$\gamma$ is not present within islets until after the process of insulitis has begun [17], implying that the initial hyperexpression of class I MHC occurs prior to the appearance of this cytokine.

What is the cause of aberrant Class II MHC antigen expression on beta cells?
Foulis et al. have shown that $\beta$-cell expression of Class II MHC molecules can be detected in islets devoid of insulitis, suggesting that aberrant expression occurs prior to immune cell infiltration [35, 42]. The signal that initiates this aberrant Class II MHC expression in $\beta$-cells has yet to be determined. Neither the type 1 IFNs (IFN$\alpha$ and IFN$\beta$) nor IFN$\gamma$ were capable of inducing the expression of Class II MHC in human $\beta$-cells grown as monolayer cultures [46]. In vitro studies have demonstrated that combinations of IFN$\gamma$ with TNF$\alpha$ can induce MHCII expression on isolated $\beta$-cells and $\beta$-cell lines [57, 58]. However, although these cytokines may contribute to the aberrant Class II MHC expression once insulitis is present, it seems unlikely that they initiate this response. Nevertheless, once the immune cells have migrated into an islet, the release of relevant immune mediators, including IFN$\gamma$ and TNF$\alpha$, could augment the pre-existing hyperexpression of MHC Class I and further enhance the expression of MHC Class II.

How do immune cells home to the islet in type 1 diabetes?

As discussed above, exposure of $\beta$-cells to IFN$\alpha$ induces the release of the chemokine CXCL10. 
When CXCL10 was specifically expressed in the islets of a mouse model of diabetes, it caused the spontaneous infiltration of relevant immune cells expressing its cognate receptor, CXCR3, thereby accelerating the development of diabetes [59]. 
The expression of CXCL10 has been demonstrated in the islets of recent-onset type 1 diabetes patients by several groups [38, 51] and it has also been detected in the serum of newly diagnosed and pre-diabetic individuals [60].
 In some cases this was associated with evidence of enteroviral infection [38, 51] and in vitro studies demonstrate that when human islets are infected with enterovirus, or stimulated with double-stranded (ds) RNA (in the form of polyIC) or IFN$\alpha$, they produce very high levels of CXCL10 at both the RNA and protein level [50, 61, 62]. In keeping with this, the infiltrating T cells in recent-onset type 1 diabetes patients (and in patients with the rarer fulminant type 1 diabetes) have been shown to express high levels of CXCR3 [38, 51]. This response combined with the increased ICAM-1 expression on islet endothelial cells and the uncharacteristic expression of both Class I and Class II MHC on the endocrine and endothelial cells, is likely to significantly contribute to the selective recruitment of autoreactive immune cells to the islet.

Enteroviruses as a potential cause of the molecular changes observed in the islets of patients with type 1 diabetes
Analysis of human recent-onset type 1 diabetic pancreases has demonstrated that islet associated abnormalities of MHC expression and insulitis are unique features of this disease. Their cause is still unclear, but one of the more common proposals is that infection of beta cells with a virus, particularly an enterovirus, could represent the triggering event in, at least, some cases. Enteroviruses are single stranded, positive sense RNA viruses that belong to the Picornaviridae family. The subgroup of enteroviruses most commonly associated with type 1 diabetes is the Coxsackie B family [23, 63--65], although other enteroviruses (interestingly, all from the HEV-B group) have also been implicated [66--70]. Human enteroviruses are ubiquitous and circulate commonly [71--73] and the majority of enteroviral infections are asymptomatic or associated with very mild symptoms. On some occasions, however, these viruses can be responsible for more serious illnesses, such as myocarditis and acute pancreatitis.

The association of enteroviruses with type 1 diabetes was first highlighted in 1969 by Gamble et al. who demonstrated that antibodies against Coxsackie B viruses were more frequently present in the circulation of recent-onset type 1 diabetes patients than controls [74]. It was subsequently shown that the seasonal incidence of type 1 diabetes correlated with a peak in enteroviral infections [75]. Since then, there have been a plethora of clinical studies demonstrating an increased incidence of enteroviral RNA in the peripheral blood or serum of recent-onset type 1 patients and autoantibody positive individuals, when compared to controls [49, 63, 76--81]. Direct evidence for the presence of virus within the pancreas has, however, proved more elusive. Nevertheless, Dotta et al. [23] reported that assembled viral particles could be detected by electron microscopic methods in the islet cells of recent-onset type 1 diabetes patients and that this correlated with expression of the enteroviral capsid protein, vp1. Sequence analysis of the virus isolated from one case revealed that it corresponded to a strain of Coxsackie B4 (CVB4). However, in analysing this sequence further, Drescher et al. [82] have questioned whether it may have arisen by contamination of the samples since they noted that it closely resembles a laboratory strain dating from a much earlier time. Whatever its provenance, both the virus isolated by Dotta et al. [23] and another CVB4 strain isolated from a type 1 diabetes pancreas by Yoon et al., were capable of infecting islet cells and in the latter case, the virus-induced diabetes when administered to a susceptible mouse strain [23, 64].

We have recently conducted a more extensive analysis of the expression of vp1 in the islet cells of 72 recent-onset type 1 diabetes patients and more than 160 relevant controls. The results were striking in that they revealed a high incidence of islet cell enteroviral infection among the patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes (more than 60% were immunopositive for vp1) with very little equivalent infection in age-matched control children [52]. Importantly, vp1 expression occurred in many islets that were devoid of insulitis, suggesting that enteroviral infection had not occurred as a consequence of islet inflammation or diabetes. In support of this, Oikarinen et al. have reported that vp1 could be detected in the islet cells of a child who had a high titre of circulating islet cell antibodies but who had not progressed to diabetes [83]. In an earlier study, evidence of enteroviral RNA was also seen in 4/65 cases of recent-onset type 1 diabetes by in situ hybridisation [84]. In addition the tropism of various enteroviral serotypes for human islets has been demonstrated in vitro [85].

When studied in vitro or in mouse models of diabetes, viral infections have the ability to induce many (possibly all) of the characteristic phenomena associated with human type 1 diabetes, as outlined in the sections above. For example, infection of isolated islets with strains of Coxsackie B results in the synthesis of IFN$\alpha$ [86] and induces expression of ICAM-1, CXCL10, PKR, mda5 and MHC Class I genes [62]. Other studies have confirmed that enteroviral infection or exposure to polyIC can induce an upregulation of MHC Class I gene expression in islet cells [61, 62]. However, to the best of our knowledge, class I MHC hyperexpression at the protein level in response to enteroviruses has not been formally proven. Nevertheless, infection of human islets with a double-stranded RNA reovirus did increase Class I MHC expression [87], implying that this pathway can be stimulated in islet cells by viral infection. In the RIP-LCMV mouse model of type 1 diabetes, infection with LCMV results in an increase in MHC class II expression on endocrine cells that occurred as early as 2 days post-infection (and 5 days prior to lymphocyte infiltration) [88]. Aberrant MHC class II expression on islets and endothelial cells may also be associated with enteroviral infection in fulminant human diabetes [38]. Interestingly, Class II MHC molecules are aberrantly expressed on epithelial cells in the intestine of type 1 diabetes patients; as is ICAM-1 [89]. This could be mediated by a similar mechanism to that which occurs in the islet cells. Indeed an ongoing enteroviral infection of the small intestine of type 1 diabetes patients has recently been demonstrated [90].

Could a persistent infection of $\beta$-cells play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes?

In addition to their well-reported propensity to induce acute infections, enteroviruses can also persistently infect a variety of organs and tissues, including the skeletal muscle and heart [91, 92] as well as various cultured cells (for example myocardial fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells [93, 94]. Some Coxsackie B viruses have also been shown to persistently infect human $\beta$-cells for up to 30 days without causing obvious cytolysis [86]. In this context, it is noteworthy that, in our recent study of vp1 expression in human pancreas, there was minimal evidence of islet cell lysis even though many of the recent-onset type 1 diabetes cases contained islet cells that were strongly immunopositive for enteroviral vp1 [23, 52], Moreover, in any given islet, the number of infected cells was always relatively small. The expression of vp1 did correlate with PKR in $\beta$-cells, a host protein that is upregulated in response to viral infection [52]. However, the correlation with Class I MHC hyperexpression was far less clear. In patients with evidence of vp1 staining there were two predominant classes of islets; those which expressed vp1 and hyperexpressed Class I MHC and those with Class I MHC hyperexpression but no vp1. Very occasionally, islets were also seen which had vp1 positive endocrine cells and no hyperexpression of class I MHC. In those patients with no vp1 staining anywhere in the pancreatic section, islets were frequently observed with Class I MHC hyperexpression. As described above, Class I MHC hyperexpression is intimately associated with $\beta$-cell production of IFN$\alpha$ production. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that many of the islets not expressing vp1 may be secreting IFN$\alpha$, but this has not been formally proven. The expression of IFN$\alpha$ has previously been associated with a persistent viral infection of islets in vitro where it is critical for islet cell survival and the inhibition of viral replication [50, 53, 86].
The detection of vp1 via immunohistochemistry in experimental acute enteroviral myocarditis in mice demonstrates that the levels of vp1 protein are at their highest under conditions where there is an excess of positive- over negative-strand viral RNA within infected cells (i.e., during the acute infection) [85]. In contrast, during the chronic phase of an infection, when the number of positive and negative enteroviral RNA strands becomes equivalent, the expression of vp1 is much less demonstrable [92]. There is also evidence from muscle biopsies that chronic infection with enterovirus is associated with the production of roughly equal amounts of positive and negative strands [91, 95]. In keeping with this, Tam et al., demonstrated that in Coxsackie virus-induced chronic inflammatory myopathy, viral RNA persisted via the formation of a double-stranded complex [96]. It is possible, therefore, that $\beta$-cells expressing IFN$\alpha$ but no vp1, may still be infected with a virus but that its genetic material is present in a more stable double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) conformation, which does not lead to significant production of viral protein (as evidenced by the lack of detectable vp1 expression).
dsRNA is sensed by the innate immune system via a variety of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), in particular TLR3, mda5, RIG1 and PKR. Mda5 is of special significance as it is essential for the production of interferons in response to infections by picornaviruses, of which enteroviruses are a sub-genus [97]. Mda5 has recently been shown to be activated by higher order RNA structures generated during virus infection, that consist of dsRNA complexed with ssRNA, resulting in the production of IFN$\alpha$ and $\beta$ [98]. If dsRNA is present in the persistently infected $\beta$-cells of recent-onset type 1 diabetes patients, then it may be the presence (or activation) of Mda5 that induces the production of IFN$\alpha$. In keeping with this idea, we find that Mda5 is present in the endocrine cells of human islets (Fig. 3), although its functional role requires further investigation. It is important to note that although a significant understanding of the genes regulated by viral infections in islet cells has been gained, the majority of such profiling experiments were carried out on islets infected for only a short period of time (i.e., during acute infection) [62]. Information about the expression profile of the islet cells during a persistent enteroviral infection is not yet available.

Schematic representation of the possible sequence events leading from the establishment of an enteroviral infection of $\beta$-cells to islet immune cell recruitment, autoimmunity and $\beta$-cell death in human type 1 diabetes.

 Following infection of a normal Insulin Containing Islet by enterovirus, the virus is detected by pathogen recognition receptors (including Mda5 and PKR) resulting in the production of IFN$\alpha$ by $\beta$-cells. Release of IFN$\alpha$ and the activation of additional anti-viral signalling pathways can then induce the hyperexpression of Class I MHC molecules, cause changes in adhesion molecule expression and lead to the aberrant expression of Class II MHC by $\beta$-cells. These alterations are accompanied by chemokine secretion and the recruitment of defined subsets of immune cells, leading to islet inflammation (insulitis). Some infected $\beta$-cells may then begin to undergo apoptosis allowing the uptake and processing of $\beta$-cell antigens by APCs. In other cases, however, the $\beta$-cells may survive the initial phase of enteroviral infection (by inhibiting viral replication upon activation of PKR and Mda5) thereby allowing the development of a more persistent, silent, infection, in which no active virus is produced. Under these conditions, a period of latency may then occur (when enterovirus is predominantly present within the cells in a double-stranded RNA form) during which net $\beta$-cell death occurs only relatively slowly. At a later date, viral replication is re-activated, and the process of immune cell recruitment may be amplified such that the rate of $\beta$-cell death is enhanced and the clinical symptoms of type 1 diabetes ensue

We propose, therefore, a working hypothesis which might apply in, at least, some cases of type 1 diabetes.
 In this model, it is envisaged that beta cells can become infected with an enterovirus, leading to persistence of the virus in a double-stranded RNA form and causing the production of IFN$\alpha$. This then triggers the release of various chemokines and culminates in a change in the expression of Class I and II MHC molecules on islet cells, as well as changes to cell adhesion molecules present on endothelial cells of the islet vasculature. Together, these facilitate the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection.
It should be emphasised that the nature of the process by which islet cell autoimmunity per se is initiated still remains unclear and is not readily explained by this model. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that autoimmunity might also arise during enteroviral infection of beta cells if, for example, this were to lead to the inappropriate presentation of beta-cell antigens to the immune system.

Summary

Immune cell recruitment occurs in a defined temporal sequence in human type 1 diabetes.
CD8+ T cells (CTL) and macrophages represent the major immune cell complement present in islets when $\beta$-cell numbers are high, suggesting that these cells could play a role in the early phase of beta-cell destruction. 
B cells are also present in the infiltrate at this stage, but they are then recruited in progressively greater numbers as $\beta$-cell mass declines.
CD4+ T cells are present in small, but consistent, numbers throughout the inflammatory process but their subtype (whether Th1 or Th2) has not been defined.

Tregs, plasma and NK cells are seen only rarely in the inflammatory infiltrate suggesting that these cells do not directly mediate $\beta$-cell death in humans.

The hyperexpression of Class I MHC antigens in islets is a defining feature of human type 1 diabetes and their upregulation is closely associated with the expression of IFN$\alpha$.

IFN$\alpha$ secretion could be triggered during the persistent infection of $\beta$-cells by an enterovirus, when the viral genome is predominantly present in the form of dsRNA. 
This may then promote the activation of downstream anti-viral responses via sensors of dsRNA such as protein kinase R and Mda5.

Aberrant expression of Class II MHC antigens on $\beta$-cells is a common finding in recent-onset type 1 diabetes pancreas but its functional relevance has yet to be determined. 

One possibility is that $\beta$-cells expressing Class II MHC molecules might regulate the functionality of CD4+ T cells, but this has not been proven.

The vascular endothelium adjacent to and within inflamed islets also shows changes in MHC antigen and adhesion protein expression in type 1 diabetes.
As such, alterations within this tissue may be involved in the selective recruitment and activation of autoreactive immune cells during islet inflammation.

Ultimately, the presence of autoreactive immune cells within inflamed islets leads to beta-cell death, but this process occurs over a protracted period of time and is incomplete at the time of clinical diagnosis.
This implies that the mode of beta-cell killing is relatively inefficient and, as such, that a window of opportunity for targeted therapeutic intervention may exist (especially if patients could be identified in the pre-diabetic phase) once the underlying immunopathology is understood more completely.

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by the selective destruction of pancreatic beta ($\beta$) cells. The understanding of the aetiology of this disease has increased dramatically in recent years by the study of tissue recovered from patients, from analysis of the responses of isolated islet and $\beta$-cells in tissue culture and via the use of animal models. However, knowledge of the immunopathology of type 1 diabetes in humans is still relatively deficient due largely to the difficulty of accessing appropriate samples. Here we review the state of current knowledge in relation to the histopathological features of the disease in humans. We focus specifically on recent-onset type 1 diabetes cases since in such patients, evidence of the ongoing disease process is still present. We chart the progression of the disease by describing the characteristic features of the pancreas, consider the sequence of immune cell infiltration and discuss the abnormalities of MHC antigen expression. The possibility that these changes might derive from a persistent enteroviral infection of the islet beta cells is examined.},

Since autoimmune responses to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are up-regulated in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), in this study GAD67-specific antibody, T cell proliferation and lymphokine production patterns were analysed in the adjuvant-treated mice to characterize the regulatory mechanisms underlying the protection. We used both spontaneous diabetes and syngeneic islet transplantation models in NOD mice. Protection against spontaneous diabetes and prevention of syngeneic islet graft rejection by CFA or BCG treatment was found to be accompanied by the production of long lasting and high titre anti-GAD67 antibody of IgG1 isotype in the sera. Uponin vitrostimulation with GAD67, draining lymph node and spleen cells from CFA-immunized NOD mice or syngeneic islet-grafted and BCG-protected NOD mice produced much more IL-4, whereas there was no significant change in IFN-$\gamma$ production. The strong early T cell proliferative response to GAD67 in CFA or BCG-immunized NOD mice was followed by a low or unresponsiveness state. Taken together, these results suggest a shift in Th1/Th2 balance in the GAD67-specific endogenous immune response to a change in Th2 levels after adjuvant treatment. We postulate that the protective effect of CFA or BCG is due to the diversion of GAD-specific endogenous cellular immune response to a non-pathogenic humoral response.},

It was reported that IRF-1 regulates important molecules required for inflammation and immune reactions. To investigate the role of IRF-1 in the development of autoimmune diabetes, we established IRF-1 deficient (IRF-1−/−) non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. IRF-1-deficient C57BL/6J mice were out-crossed to NOD mice, and F1 were backcrossed to NOD mice. At the N8 generation, the heterozygote for IRF-1 mutation was intercrossed and N8F1 was obtained. Out of three NOD genotypes, IRF-1+/+and IRF-1+/−developed spontaneous diabetes with an incidence of 47% (9/19) and 50% (10/20) by 30 weeks of age, respectively; whereas IRF-1−/−did not develop diabetes (0/18, P{\&}lt; 0.01 vs.+/+and+/−). Histologically, IRF-1+/+and IRF-1+/−had various degrees of insulitis, but IRF-1−/−had no insulitis. In comparison with IRF-1+/+, the percentage of CD4+and Mac-1+splenic cells significantly increased, whereas CD3+, CD8+and B220+cells decreased in IRF-1−/−. Furthermore, spleen cell proliferation in response to Con A or murine GAD65 peptide, a major autoantigen of the pancreatic $\beta$-cell, significantly increased, and the IFN-$\gamma$/IL-10 ratio in the culture supernatant significantly decreased in IRF-1−/−, suggesting Th2 deviation in cytokine balance. These results indicate that IRF-1 plays a key role in developing insulitis and diabetes in NOD mice.},

NSY mice were found to be extremely sensitive to STZ. Introgression of a single Chr 11, where STZ-sensitivity was mapped in the NOD mouse, from NSY mice converted STZ-resistant C3H mice to STZ-sensitive. Two nucleotide substitutions were identified in the nucleoredoxin gene, a positional and functional candidate gene for STZ-induced diabetes on Chr 11. These data, together with the co-localization of type 1 (Idd4) and type 2 (Nidd1n) susceptibility genes on Chr 11, suggest that the intrinsic vulnerability of pancreatic $\beta$ cells is determined by a gene or genes on Chr 11, which may also contribute to susceptibility to spontaneous diabetes.},

Its aetiology involves complex interactions between multiple genetic and environmental factors, its pathogenesis involves interactions between many leukocyte subsets and their associated cytokines and its complications affect nearly every organ in the body. Modelling the disease is, therefore, the subject of much effort and surprising ingenuity. In this article, we review established and emerging models of the disease and give an indication of their use for different types of study. Section Editor: Daniel Altmann -- Human Disease Immunogenetics Group, Imperial College, London, UK Autoimmune diabetes is now considered to be a prototypical example of a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. In recent years, there has been enormous progress in the analysis of the genetic and immunological mechanisms underlying this disease. In turn, this is leading to several new therapeutic strategies. These efforts have been helped considerably by the convergence of findings from clinical studies and rodent models, especially those based on the nonobese diabetic mouse strain.

Natural Killer Cells are rare but it must be accepted that the unequivocal detection of NK cells in man is fraught with difficulty because of the lack of highly specific markers and the probable existence of several NK subsets having different phenotypes. However, we used a range of different markers in an attempt to define NK cells and were not able to detect the presence of large numbers of these cells in inflamed islets. This result concurs with our observation that the total number of CD45+ cells was approximately equal to the summated number of CD8+, CD4+ and CD20+ cells within any given islet, suggesting that no additional CD45+ immune cell type was present in large numbers. This conclusion can be drawn because NK cells are immunopositive for CD45 but do not express CD4, CD8 or CD20. The relative lack of NK cells is also consistent with previous findings that major histocompatibilty complex (MHC) class 1 antigens are overexpressed by the endocrine cells during islet inflammation in man [16,26], and the understanding that engagement of MHC class 1 ligands is inhibitory to NK cell function [9,10]. 

Thus, even if NK cells were present in inflamed islets, it is unlikely that these could be involved functionally in beta cell cytotoxicity as they would be inhibited by the overexpression of MHC class 1 antigens. 

Once beta cell destruction was complete and the islets became insulin-deficient (category 1), the number of all subsets of immune cells declined dramatically, suggesting that immune cells are retained within islets only when viable beta cells are present.

 Glucagon staining was normal in such islets, consistent with the failure of infiltrating immune cells to induce the death of alpha cells which implies that the principal chemokine gradients promoting immune cell recruitment and retention probably originate from within the beta cells themselves and that, once these cells are lost, the stimulus for insulitis declines - this stimulus is 

In conclusion, the present study has revealed, in detail, the immune cell subsets present within the islets at different stages of beta cell destruction in recent-onset human T1D. 

The results imply that specific immune cells especially the CTLs are recruited in a defined temporal manner during insulitis to mediate beta cell death in man.},

Pancreas samples removed post-mortem from 29 patients (mean age 11.7 years) with recent-onset T1D were analysed by immunohistochemistry. The cell types constituting the inflammatory infiltrate within islets (insulitis) were determined in parallel with islet insulin content. CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells were the most abundant population during insulitis. Macrophages (CD68(+)) were also present during both early and later insulitis, although in fewer numbers. CD20(+) cells were present in only small numbers in early insulitis but were recruited to islets as beta cell death progressed. CD138(+) plasma cells were infrequent at all stages of insulitis. CD4(+) cells were present in the islet infiltrate in all patients but were less abundant than CD8(+) or CD68(+) cells. Forkhead box protein P3(+) regulatory T cells were detected in the islets of only a single patient. Natural killer cells were detected rarely, even in heavily inflamed islets. The results suggest a defined sequence of immune cell recruitment in human T1D. They imply that both CD8(+) cytotoxic cells and macrophages may contribute to beta cell death during early insulitis. CD20(+) cells are recruited in greatest numbers during late insulitis, suggesting an increasing role for these cells as insulitis develops. Natural killer cells and forkhead box protein P3(+) T cells do not appear to be required for beta cell death.},

Our goal was to compare the prevalence of T2D family history between adults with T1D from a multiethnic population and a non-diabetic control group. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 145 adults with T1D and 141 healthy adults (control group) that included an interview and a review of the medical charts. Groups were matched for age, sex, ethnicity and body mass index (BMI).

Herein, we describe the scientific and therapeutic rationale underlying efforts utilizing umbilical cord blood (UCB) as a therapy for ameliorating the progression of this autoimmune disease. Materials and Methods We recently embarked on a pilot study to document the safety and potential efficacy of autologous UCB infusion in subjects with T1D. Under this protocol, patients recently diagnosed with the disease and for whom autologous cord blood is stored, undergo infusion. Studies are performed before infusion and every 3 to 6 months postinfusion for immunologic and metabolic assessment. To date, 15 autologous infusions have been performed. Results Preliminary observations suggest that autologous cord blood transfusion is safe and provides some slowing of the loss of endogenous insulin production in children with T1D. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that umbilical cord blood contains highly functional populations of regulatory T cells (Treg) and that increased Treg populations may be found in the peripheral blood of subjects more than 6 months after cord blood infusion. We provide the rationale for cord blood--based therapies, a summary of our initial protocol, and plans for future studies designed to explore the potential of cord blood--derived regulatory T cells to treat T1D. Conclusions Prolonged follow-up and additional mechanistic efforts are urgently needed to determine if umbilical cord blood--derived stem cells can be used as part of safe and effective therapies for T1D.},

As this enzyme has an important role in processing antigenic peptides for the HLA I molecules, a variant that drastically modulates its expression levels might affect risk of autoimmunity. This study was designed to confirm that LRAP expression in B-cell derived lines is controlled by a haplotype marked by rs2762 and to see whether this would be the basis of an association with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods Single-nucleotide primer extension (SNuPE) was adapted to determine the haplotype-specific expression. Genetic association was tested in 892 nuclear families with one T1D-affected offspring and two parents (2676 individuals). Results All nine heterozygous RNA samples showed an eight-fold higher level of one haplotype over the other (7.97{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;0.99, p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;1.33{\&}{\#}xa0;×{\&}{\#}xa0;10−9). However, no association of rs2762 with T1D was found by the transmission disequilibrium test (transmission ratio A/G{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;377/388, p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.69). Conclusions/interpretation The genetically determined LRAP expression does not play significant roles in T1D. However, this dramatic genetic effect on LRAP expression justifies further investigation of association with other phenotypes, especially autoimmune and related to host defense to specific pathogens.},

abstract = {Defining and characterizing pathologies of the immune system requires precise and accurate quantification of abundances and functions of cellular subsets via cytometric studies. At this time, data analysis relies on manual gating, which is a major source of variability in large-scale studies. We devised an automated, user-guided method, X-Cyt, which specializes in rapidly and robustly identifying targeted populations of interest in large data sets. We first applied X-Cyt to quantify CD4(+) effector and central memory T cells in 236 samples, demonstrating high concordance with manual analysis (r = 0.91 and 0.95, respectively) and superior performance to other available methods. We then quantified the rare mucosal associated invariant T cell population in 35 samples, achieving manual concordance of 0.98. Finally we characterized the population dynamics of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, a particularly rare peripheral lymphocyte, in 110 individuals by assaying 19 markers. We demonstrated that although iNKT cell numbers and marker expression are highly variable in the population, iNKT abundance correlates with sex and age, and the expression of phenotypic and functional markers correlates closely with CD4 expression.},

abstract = {NOD mice are used as experimental models as they develop type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM-1) spontaneously, with a strong similarity to the human disease. Diabetes mellitus type 1 is characterized by the destruction of the islet, orchestrated by T lymphocytes that induce cytokine release like IL-1$\beta$, promoting an inflammatory process. Diacerhein has antiinflammatory properties, inhibiting IL-1. However, the mechanisms involved in immune modulation are not completely understood. In the present study, serum and pancreatic islets were isolated to investigate the relationship between IL-1$\beta$, IFN-$\gamma$, IL-12 and TNF-$\alpha$ expression and diabetes onset, morphological aspects, and diacerhein dose dependence in animals treated with different doses (5, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day) and the control group (saline solution). The results demonstrated upregulation of mRNA islets and downregulation of the serum concentration of IL-1$\beta$, IL-12 and TNF-$\alpha$ in the group treated with 5 and 10 mg/kg/day diacerhein, when compared with the saline group, and increased IFN-$\gamma$ serum concentration in the group treated with 50 mg/kg/day. These results suggest that diacerhein in NOD mice, decreases, in a dose-dependent manner, the diabetes frequency downregulating proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1$\beta$, TNF-$\alpha$, IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-12 at posttranscriptional or posttranslational level. Furthermore, using the HPLC method, diacerhein and rhein (active metabolite) were detected in serum and pancreas of treated mice.},

abstract = {Gamma interferon (IFN-$\gamma$) has been thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes. This report determines if rIFN-$\gamma$ administration to NOD mice paradoxically inhibits the development of diabetes. Injections of recombinant rIFN-$\gamma$ of 5×103, 20×103, and 100×103 units, dose dependently inhibited the development of diabetes. The maximal rIFN-$\gamma$ dose decreased the incidence of diabetes from 74% in control animals to 42%. 100×103 unit rIFN-$\gamma$ dose significantly decreased insulitis score, and increased islet number. The development of diabetes in irradiated NOD mice was slower in animals injected with spleen cells from rIFN-$\gamma$ treated than from saline treated NOD mice suggesting that rIFN-$\gamma$ decreases anti-islet effector cell activity. The susceptibility to apoptosis was increased in splenic cells of rIFN-$\gamma$ treated mice. The expressions of the co-stimulatory molecules B7-2 and ICAM-1 were significantly increased in spleen cells of rIFN-$\gamma$ treated mice while the expression of MHC class I was decreased. In vitro studies demonstrated that NOD mouse mononuclear spleen cells preincubated with rIFN-$\gamma$ and subsequently cocultured with responder cells, potently inhibited responder T-cell proliferative responses. rIFN-$\gamma$ administration decreased IL-12 and IL-2 mRNA expression in spleen cells while increasing IL-1 expression. In conclusion, rIFN-$\gamma$ inhibits the diabetic process in NOD mice by decreasing anti-islet effector activity and in turn decreasing insulitis and islet destruction. The suppression of Th1 cell related cytokines and/or augmentation of the macrophage cytokine IL-1 may play a role in the diabetes sparing effect of rIFN-$\gamma$.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Most methods for estimating differential expression from RNA-seq are based on statistics that compare normalized read counts between treatment classes. Unfortunately, reads are in general too short to be mapped unambiguously to features of interest, such as genes, isoforms or haplotype-specific isoforms. There are methods for estimating expression levels that account for this source of ambiguity. However, the uncertainty is not generally accounted for in downstream analysis of gene expression experiments. Moreover, at the individual transcript level, it can sometimes be too large to allow useful comparisons between treatment groups.

RESULTS:In this article we make two proposals that improve the power, specificity and versatility of expression analysis using RNA-seq data. First, we present a Bayesian method for model selection that accounts for read mapping ambiguities using random effects. This polytomous model selection approach can be used to identify many interesting patterns of gene expression and is not confined to detecting differential expression between two groups. For illustration, we use our method to detect imprinting, different types of regulatory divergence in cis and in trans and differential isoform usage, but many other applications are possible. Second, we present a novel collapsing algorithm for grouping transcripts into inferential units that exploits the posterior correlation between transcript expression levels. The aggregate expression levels of these units can be estimated with useful levels of uncertainty. Our algorithm can improve the precision of expression estimates when uncertainty is large with only a small reduction in biological resolution.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is a widely deployed transcriptome profiling and annotation technique, but questions about the performance of different protocols and platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths, and GC content covering a 2(20) concentration range as spike-in controls to measure sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in RNA-seq experiments as well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read density and RNA input over the entire detection range and excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure Poisson sampling errors. We use the control RNAs to directly measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to GC content and transcript length as well as stereotypic heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with position relative to RNA termini and priming sequence bias. These effects lead to biased quantification for short transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the control RNAs, we derive limits for the discovery and detection of rare transcripts in RNA-seq experiments. By using data collected as part of the model organism and human Encyclopedia of DNA Elements projects (ENCODE and modENCODE), we demonstrate that external RNA controls are a useful resource for evaluating sensitivity and accuracy of RNA-seq experiments for transcriptome discovery and quantification. These quality metrics facilitate comparable analysis across different samples, protocols, and platforms.},

abstract = {Copy-number variation (CNV) is a major contributor to human genetic variation. Recently, CNV associations with human disease have been reported. Many genome-wide association (GWA) studies in complex diseases have been performed with sets of biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but the available CNV methods are still limited. We present a new method (TriTyper) that can infer genotypes in case-control data sets for deletion CNVs, or SNPs with an extra, untyped allele at a high-resolution single SNP level. By accounting for linkage disequilibrium (LD), as well as intensity data, calling accuracy is improved. Analysis of 3102 unrelated individuals with European descent, genotyped with Illumina Infinium BeadChips, resulted in the identification of 1880 SNPs with a common untyped allele, and these SNPs are in strong LD with neighboring biallelic SNPs. Simulations indicate our method has superior power to detect associations compared to biallelic SNPs that are in LD with these SNPs, yet without increasing type I errors, as shown in a GWA analysis in celiac disease. Genotypes for 1204 triallelic SNPs could be fully imputed, with only biallelic-genotype calls, permitting association analysis of these SNPs in many published data sets. We estimate that 682 of the 1655 unique loci reflect deletions; this is on average 99 deletions per individual, four times greater than those detected by other methods. Whereas the identified loci are strongly enriched for known deletions, 61% have not been reported before. Genes overlapping with these loci more often have paralogs (p = 0.006) and biologically interact with fewer genes than expected (p = 0.004).},

abstract = {Natural killer (NK) cells contribute to the essential functions of innate immunity and reproduction. Various genes encode NK cell receptors that recognize the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I molecules expressed by other cells. For primate NK cells, the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are a variable and rapidly evolving family of MHC Class I receptors. Studied here is KIR3DL1/S1, which encodes receptors for highly polymorphic human HLA-A and -B and comprises three ancient allelic lineages that have been preserved by balancing selection throughout human evolution. While the 3DS1 lineage of activating receptors has been conserved, the two 3DL1 lineages of inhibitory receptors were diversified through inter-lineage recombination with each other and with 3DS1. Prominent targets for recombination were D0-domain polymorphisms, which modulate enhancer function, and dimorphism at position 283 in the D2 domain, which influences inhibitory function. In African populations, unequal crossing over between the 3DL1 and 3DL2 genes produced a deleted KIR haplotype in which the telomeric "half" was reduced to a single fusion gene with functional properties distinct from its 3DL1 and 3DL2 parents. Conversely, in Eurasian populations, duplication of the KIR3DL1/S1 locus by unequal crossing over has enabled individuals to carry and express alleles of all three KIR3DL1/S1 lineages. These results demonstrate how meiotic recombination combines with an ancient, preserved diversity to create new KIR phenotypes upon which natural selection acts. A consequence of such recombination is to blur the distinction between alleles and loci in the rapidly evolving human KIR gene family.},

abstract = {BB rats and nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop autoimmune insulin dependent diabetes and serve as models for human type I diabetes. During progression of the disease the cytokine pattern elaborated by islet infiltrating immune cells shifts from a Th2 or Th0 toward Thl type. Only the latter is associated with ``destructive'' insulitis. We discuss here attempts to modulate disease progression by targeting the gut immune system with bacterial immunostimulants. Oral dosing of diabetes prone BB rats with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the Escherichia coli extract OM-89 lead to a Th2-shift of pancreatic mRNA expression. In vitro studies showed that repeated exposure toward LPS or OM-89 lead to downregulation of proinflammatory macrophage responses. In the NOD mouse, repeated oral dosing of OM-89 caused a Th2 shift in the gut cytokine gene expression, probably because of desensitization of macrophages and other antigen presenting cells. Concomitantly, diabetes prevention by oral insulin was improved. In conclusion, oral dosing with bacterial immunostimulants dampens Th 1 type immune reactivities of the gut immune system and thereby promotes oral tolerance mechanisms. Downregulation of proinflammatory immune reactivities by repeated exposure to bacterial stimulants requires intact desensitization mechanisms in macrophages or other antigen presenting cells.},

Administration of cyclophosphamide to non-diabetic recipients accelerated the development of diabetes, while none of the mice with anti-CD8 antibody did so. Similarly, it was observed that neonates that received islet-derived CD8+T cells developed diabetes and obvious insulitis mainly with CD4+T cells. Administration of anti-CD4 antibody with transfer of CD8+T cells inhibited insulitis.

These transgenic NOD mice develop diabetes with the same kinetics and incidence as wild type NOD mice, permitting the physiological characterization of CD4+hCD90+ cells, which represent TH1 cells in lymphoid organs and at the site of insulitis. CD4+hCD90+ cells had a higher capacity to secret IFN-$\gamma$ than CD4+hCD90− cells in an autoantigen-specific manner. Transgenic mice treated with GAD65 plasmid were protected from autoimmune diabetes, and had a lower number of CD4+hCD90+ cells, confirming the pathogenic role of CD4+hCD90+ cells in autoimmune diabetes. To further investigate the effect of IL-12 on the development of TH1 cells in autoimmune diabetes, we crossed these doubly transgenic mice to IL-12p35-deficient NOD mice. Despite severe disturbance of diabetes in p35−/− mice, the frequency of TH1 cells in these mice was slightly lower than in wild type mice. These data support the pathological role of IL-12 in autoimmune diabetes and suggest the existence an IL-12-independent pathway of TH1 development.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is an immuno-inflammatory condition which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly in young adults. This study investigated whether vascular function is altered in mice prone to autoimmune diabetes and whether the nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic GMP axis is involved. Aortic rings suspended in organ chambers and precontracted with phenylephrine were exposed to cumulative concentrations of acetylcholine. To investigate the role of NO, some experiments were performed in the presence of either 1400W (N-(3-aminomethyl)benzyl-acetamidine hydrochloride), a selective inhibitor of the iNOS-isoform, l-NAME (NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride), an inhibitor of all three NOS-isoforms, or ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one), a selective inhibitor of guanylate cyclase. Moreover, contractility to phenylephrine, big endothelin-1, and endothelin-1 was assessed and histological analysis and iNOS immunohistochemistry were performed. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was reduced in prediabetic NOD mice (78{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;4 vs. 88{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;2%, respectively, P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05 vs. control) despite normal plasma glucose levels (n.s. vs. control). Preincubation with 1400W further attenuated responses in prediabetic (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05 vs. untreated) but not in diabetic or in control mice. In contrast, basal NO bioactivity remained unaffected until the onset of diabetes in NOD mice. Contractile responses to big endothelin-1 and endothelin-1 were reduced in prediabetic animals (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05 vs. control), whereas in diabetic mice only responses to big endothelin-1 were decreased (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05 vs. control). These data demonstrate that endothelium-dependent and -independent vascular function in NOD mice is abnormal already in prediabetes in the absence of structural injury. Early proinflammatory activation due to iNOS in diabetes-prone NOD mice appears to be one of the mechanisms contributing to impaired vasoreactivity.},

Nucleotide sequence analysis of VH-6-expressing clones revealed that each clone utilizes a short DH segment, resulting in a CDR3 region of conserved length.

Protection was not reversed when anti-CD3 injection was followed by anti-CD4 and anti-CD8. Animals neonatally injected with anti-CD3 were not protected from the induction of diabetes following transfer of spleen cells from diabetic donors. These results contrast with the view that anti-CD3-mediated protection from diabetes depends on a long-lived change in recipient T cells.

Remarkable advances in genomic technology have recently enabled the discovery of a large number of disease-associated gene variations by genome-wide association studies. The next step towards understanding autoimmune disorders entails the functional study of susceptibility genes within experimental disease models. RNA interference (RNAi) is a promising tool for such investigations. Several features of RNAi, including its specificity, versatility and reversible nature, allow experimental systems to be tailored to relevant gene variations. This review discusses how the experimental use of RNAi is invaluable in bridging the gap between the identification of susceptibility genes and the elucidation of their functional contribution to autoimmune disease.},

The case for developing novel methods of gene therapy for the prevention of recurrent diabetes following islet cell transplantation is well established given the extensive and unfortunate history of clinical failures as well as the side effects associated with chronic immunosuppression. Gene therapy approaches aimed at the creation of insulin producing apparatus in surrogate tissues and at islet cell neogenesis from stem cells hold a great promise in circumventing some of the immunological problems associated with islet cell transplantation. Many vectors are currently being subjected to investigation in an attempt to improve gene delivery into islets and ensure patient safety. Viral vectors have shown the ability to target and enter host cells with a high degree of efficiency and, therefore, form the subject of most such efforts, with recent improvements in the propagation and delivery of recombinant adeno-associated virus causing major enthusiasm.},

However, a direct correlation and exact mechanism continue to elude investigators due to scarce and conflicting data. Interestingly, there is also data to support an opposite role for infection in the development of type 1 diabetes, as several pathogens demonstrated a protective effect from this disease.

abstract = {The signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family of proteins play a critical role in cytokine signaling required for fine tuning of immune regulation. Previous reports showed that a mutation (L327M) in the Stat5b protein leads to aberrant cytokine signaling in the NOD mice. To further elaborate the role of Stat5b in diabetes, we established a NOD transgenic mouse that over-expresses the wild type Stat5b gene. The incidences of spontaneous diabetes as well as cyclophosphamide-induced diabetes were significantly reduced and delayed in the Stat5b transgenic NOD mice compared to their littermate controls. The total cell numbers of CD4+ T cells and especially CD8+ T cells in the spleen and pancreatic lymph node were increased in the Stat5b transgenic NOD mice. Consistent with these findings, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the Stat5b transgenic NOD mice showed a higher proliferation capacity and up-regulation of multiple cytokines including IL-2, IFN-$\gamma$, TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-10 as well as anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-xl. Furthermore, the number and proportion of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells were significantly increased in transgenic mice although in vitro suppression ability of the regulatory T-cells was not affected by the transgene. Our results suggest that Stat5b confers protection against diabetes in the NOD mice by regulating the numbers and function of multiple immune cell types, especially by up-regulating CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells.},

abstract = {Introduction Type 1A diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease resulting from the selective destruction of pancreatic beta cells by T cells most likely due to interaction of environmental and genetic factors. The CD4(+) T cells, largely implicated in this disease, comprise different subsets; based on the cytokines they produce. These subsets include Th1, Th2, regulatory T cells and another population of recently described T cells called Th17 cells. Increased expression of interleukin 17 (IL-17) has been detected in sera and in target tissues of patients with various autoimmune diseases. The differentiation of Th17 cells from na{\"\i}ve T cells appears to involve signals from TGF-beta, IL-6, IL-21, IL-1beta and IL-23. IL-23, a member of the IL-12 family, which activate the effector function of Th17 cells to promote inflammatory responses. In animal models, IL-23 is involved in the development of autoimmune diabetes. In humans, it seems to cause multi-organ inflammation, contributing to rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease manifestations. Conclusions The discovery that certain autoimmune disorders might be largely mediated by an unregulated IL-23/IL-17 response has important implications for the development of novel therapies for these diseases.},

abstract = {The field of Type 1 diabetes research has been quick to embrace the era of translational medicine in the recent epoch. Building upon some 30 years of intense immunological research, the past decade has been marked by a series of clinical trials designed to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of a range of immune intervention and prevention strategies [1**,2--5]. At the heart of Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune process, the consequence of which is immune-mediated destruction of islet $\beta$-cells. Although understanding the pathogenesis of islet autoimmunity is critical, there are also good reasons to focus research onto the $\beta$-cell destructive process itself. Measuring preservation of function of insulin-producing cells is currently the best means available to evaluate potential beneficial effects of immunotherapy, but there is an urgent need to discover and monitor immunological correlates of this $\beta$-cell destructive process. Whilst the best approach to intervention and prevention has yet to emerge, it is logical that future attempts to intelligently design therapeutics for Type 1 diabetes will need to be predicated on a clear understanding of the process of $\beta$-cell destruction and the immune components involved. For these reasons, this review will focus on the role of diabetogenic T lymphocytes in this disease-defining event.},

Here, we show that extensive blockade of IFN-$\alpha$ action by a monoclonal antibody specific to IFN-$\alpha$ receptor 1 results in nearly complete prevention of T1D in NOD mice. Whether professional IFN-$\alpha$ producing cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), are responsible for the initiation of T1D has been unclear.

abstract = {Background Progress in peptide immunotherapy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases has been hampered by reports of anaphylactic reactions in both mice and human subjects. Fatal anaphylaxis in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice has been described after repeated subcutaneous insulin peptide B:9-23 immunizations. On the basis of observations that rapid systemic delivery of peptide to a sensitized mouse (eg, intravenous delivery) increases the anaphylactic response, it was hypothesized that slowing down the absorption of the peptide would prevent anaphylaxis. Objectives We sought to prevent anaphylaxis from B:9-23 peptide by altering the isoelectric point (pI) to neutral, thereby decreasing solubility and rate of absorption after subcutaneous injection. Methods B:9-23 peptide was modified by the addition of 2 arginine (RR) amino acids to the C-terminus to create B:9-23RR, thereby increasing the pI from 5.4 to 7.0. Both native and modified B:9-23 peptide were tested for the ability to induce anaphylaxis in a NOD mouse model of self-peptide anaphylaxis. Results This modification resulted in a peptide vaccine with decreased solubility when administered subcutaneously at a neutral pH. B:9-23RR significantly protected NOD mice from peptide-induced anaphylaxis compared with B:9-23 peptide. Furthermore, B:9-23RR peptide retains its ability to induce insulin autoantibodies and prevent diabetes in NOD mice. Conclusion The modification of the pI of a peptide vaccine might be a generalizable method to prevent anaphylaxis without changing the immunologic properties.},

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder caused by cellular-mediated destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic $\beta$ cells in the islets of Langerhans. Indeed, local infiltration of islets by mononuclear cells is the hallmark of Type 1 diabetes. Based on both FTY720's action and the involvement of cellular infiltration in the disease progression, we tested FTY720 for its ability to prevent autoimmune diabetes in diabetes-prone, nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. We found that treatment with FTY720 completely prevented NOD mice from developing autoimmune diabetes. The FTY720-treated animals showed both reduced numbers of circulating lymphocytes and sharply diminished cellular infiltration of pancreatic islets. These results suggest that FTY720 may be effective in prevention of autoimmune diabetes or in slowing its progression.},

The incidence of diabetes is greater in females but the degree of insulitis is comparable in both sexes. The purpose of this study was to assess the populations of lymphocytes and macrophages in the pancreas and spleen of NOD mice. Comparisons were made between male and female; young (32--40 days old) and old (197--297 days old); diabetic and non-diabetic mice. Using analytical fluorescent cell cytometry we quantitated the percentages of CD4, and CD8 T-cells, B-cells and macrophages and the percentages of these subsets expressing interleukin-2 (IL-2R), prolactin (PRLR) and Hi-intensity PRL (Hi-PRLR) receptors. Evaluation of T-splenocytes indicated a 2:1 ratio of CD4 to CD8 T-lymphocytes in the spleen. The pancreas had higher percentages of all of the subsets in the old male and female groups compared to their young counterparts. Pancreatic immunocompetent cell subsets expressed lower percentages of IL-2R, PRLR and Hi-PRLR compared to splenocytes. The results did not demonstrate any dramatic differences in the immunocompetent cell populations of the spleen or pancreas between male and female animals, however we were able to establish the percentage of immunocompetent cells with IL-2R, PRLR and Hi-PRLR as a reference for future studies.},

abstract = {The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse displays several immune related defects, each of which could potentially contribute to the immunopathogenesis of diabetes that spontaneously develops in these mice. The reported resistance of NOD-lymphocytes to several apoptosis-inducing signals constitutes one such factor. Apoptosis plays a key role in the homeostasis of the immune system, as a means of selecting lymphocyte repertoires both in primary lymphoid organs and in the periphery; distortions in the apoptotic machinery may therefore be hypothesized to be implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. We now report that cyclophosphamide constitutes an apoptosis signal to peripheral lymphocytes and we provide evidence that NOD B cells as well as both CD4 and CD8 T cells display resistance to cyclophosphamide-induced apoptosis. These observations support the notion that apoptosis resistance in NOD mice exists at various levels, and suggest that the CY-sensitive lymphoid population, believed to play an important role in inhibiting the disease in diabetes resistant NOD mice (particularly males), may be controlled by mechanisms that are mediated by apoptosis.},

abstract = {Most studies performed to investigate the role of the inducible bradykinin B1 receptor in the pathology and complications of type 1 diabetes have been carried out using the model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. The model of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice involves a long-term inflammatory process that closely resembles the human type 1 diabetes. In the present study, we aimed at establishing the correlation between the progress of diabetic hyperalgesia and the incidence of diabetes, as a function of age, in NOD mice. We also evaluated the implication of the bradykinin B1 receptor, a receptor up-regulated during the inflammatory progress of diabetes, in the development of diabetic hyperalgesia in NOD mice. Female NOD mice were followed up from the 4th to the 32nd week of age for the incidence of diabetes. Only NOD mice with plasma glucose concentration {\&}gt;{\&}{\#}xa0;20 mmol/l were considered diabetic. The nociception was assessed using the hot plate and the tail immersion pain tests and the effect of acute and chronic administration of the selective bradykinin B1 receptor agonist, desArg9bradykinin and its selective antagonists, R-715 (Ac-Lys-[D-$\beta$ Nal7, Ile8]desArg9bradykinin) and R-954 (Ac-Orn-[Oic2, $\alpha$-MePhe5, D-$\beta$ Nal7, Ile8]desArg9bradykinin), on the development of diabetic hyperalgesia was studied. Diabetic NOD mice developed a significant time-dependent hyperalgesia, as measured in both tests, starting from the 8th week of age with the maximum effect observed over 16 to 20 weeks, whereas the incidence of diabetes in the tested NOD mice was only 40.16% at the age of 16 weeks and reached a maximum of 73.23% at the age 24 weeks. Both acute and chronic administration of desArg9bradykinin (400 $\mu$g/kg) markedly increased the hyperalgesic activity in diabetic NOD mice in the hot plate and tail immersion nociceptive tests. The selective bradykinin B1 receptor antagonist R-715 (400 $\mu$g/kg) and its more potent and long acting analogue R-954 (200 $\mu$g/kg), administered in acute or chronic manner, significantly attenuated diabetic hyperalgesia in NOD mice in both thermal pain tests and restored nociceptive responses to values observed in control non-diabetic siblings. Our results bring the first evidence that the development of hyperalgesia in NOD mice, a model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes, precedes the occurrence of hyperglycemia and is mediated by the bradykinin B1 receptor. It is suggested that bradykinin B1 receptor antagonism could become a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of diabetic neuropathic complications.},

We examined the relationship between diabetes autoantibodies (DAA), human leukocyte antigen (HLA), and clinical course in subjects grouped by clinical diabetes type. Methods Subjects 8--18{\&}{\#}xa0;years old with T1D, T2D, and mixed clinical features (T1.5D), were studied at diagnosis. DAA were measured in all subjects; a subset of subjects underwent HLA genotyping. Clinical course was followed in 84% of subjects for 47.9+8.7 months. Results Eighty-nine percent of T1.5D subjects were positive for at least one DAA; 88% of HLA-typed subjects had risk HLA genotypes. Two subjects initially treated with oral agents were subsequently treated with insulin (50%); one had risk HLA, and the other was DAA positive. Thirty-three percent of T2D subjects were DAA positive and 93% were treated with oral agents at diagnosis. Three subjects were subsequently treated with insulin (21%); of these, two were DAA positive, and one had risk HLA. No subject who remained on diet therapy or oral agents had a combination of DAA-positivity and risk HLA genotype. Conclusions Children clinically classified with T1.5D or T2D have a high frequency of autoimmune markers and T1D-associated HLA alleles which appears to indicate a more aggressive diabetes disease process, as has been shown for DAA-positive adults with phenotypic T2D.},

Daintain/AIF-1 (Allograft Inflammatory Factor-1), a specific marker for activated macrophages, is accumulated in the pancreatic islets of pre-diabetic BB rats. In the present study, we demonstrate that daintain/AIF-1 is released into blood and the levels of daintain/AIF-1 in the blood of type 1 diabetes-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice suffering from insulitis are significantly higher than that in healthy NOD mice. When injected intravenously into NOD mice, daintain/AIF-1 stimulates white blood cell proliferation, increases the concentrations of blood glucose, impairs insulin expression, up-regulates nitric oxide (NO) production in pancreases and accelerates diabetes in NOD mice, while the antibody against daintain/AIF-1 delays or prevents insulitis in NOD mice. These results imply daintain/AIF-1 triggers type 1 diabetes probably via arousing immune cells activation and induction of NO production in pancreas of NOD mice.},

We therefore determined whether dietary bafilomycin influenced the progression of diabetes in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of autoimmune Type 1 diabetes. Parent NOD mice were fed sub-toxic doses of bafilomycin in drinking water from conception until weaning, or various times after birth and blood glucose was monitored in the offspring. Pancreatic islets in neonatal offspring were examined histologically by quantitative morphometry and islet cell apoptosis was estimated by TUNEL assay. Exposure in utero to bafilomycin but not after birth significantly accelerated onset and increased the frequency of diabetes. In exposed mice, pancreatic islet organogenesis was disrupted, characterized by a striking increase in $\beta$-cell mass and a shift in timing of the normal wave of neonatal islet cell apoptosis from 2 weeks to 4 weeks of age. We postulate that accelerated onset and increased incidence of diabetes later in life result from disruption of the normal turnover of $\beta$ cells in the neonatal pancreas. Since bafilomycin and related plecomacrolides contaminate Streptomyces-infected vegetables, dietary exposure during pregnancy could be an important and previously unsuspected environmental component of human Type 1 diabetes.},

In some mice (but not all) infiltration of the islets leads to selective destruction of insulin-producing beta cells, which is marked by clinically overt diabetes and is thought to be an autoimmune response mediated by T cells [1, 2]. Both L3T4+ and Ly2+ cells have been implicated in the destructive process and we have used an in vivo transfer system, together with histological studies on the pancreas, to demonstrate the essential role played by Ly 2+ T cells in the destruction of beta cells in diabetic mice.},

abstract = {Zinc is an essential trace element crucial for the function of more than 300 enzymes and it is important for cellular processes like cell division and apoptosis. Hence, the concentration of zinc in the human body is tightly regulated and disturbances of zinc homeostasis have been associated with several diseases including diabetes mellitus, a disease characterized by high blood glucose concentrations as a consequence of decreased secretion or action of insulin. Zinc supplementation of animals and humans has been shown to ameliorate glycemic control in type 1 and 2 diabetes, the two major forms of diabetes mellitus, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have only slowly been elucidated. Zinc seems to exert insulin-like effects by supporting the signal transduction of insulin and by reducing the production of cytokines, which lead to beta-cell death during the inflammatory process in the pancreas in the course of the disease. Furthermore, zinc might play a role in the development of diabetes, since genetic polymorphisms in the gene of zinc transporter 8 and in metallothionein (MT)-encoding genes could be demonstrated to be associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The fact that antibodies against this zinc transporter have been detected in type 1 diabetic patients offers new diagnostic possibilities. This article reviews the influence of zinc on the diabetic state including the molecular mechanisms, the role of the zinc transporter 8 and MT for diabetes development and the resulting diagnostic and therapeutic options.},

For the first time, we examine penetrance of susceptibility genes for multiple MHC gene-determined traits in the same subjects. Serum levels of IgA, IgD, IgG3, but not IgG4, in 50 pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for type 1 diabetes (T1D) correlated more closely in the twins than in random paired controls. The frequencies of subjects deficient in IgA (6%), IgD (33%) and IgG4 (12%), but not in IgG3, were higher in the twins than in controls. We postulate that this was because the MHC haplotypes (and possible non-MHC genes) that predispose to T1D also carry susceptibility genes for certain immunoglobulin deficiencies. Immunoglobulin deficiencies were not associated with T1D. Pairwise concordance for the deficiencies in the twins was 50% for IgA, 57% for IgD and 50% for IgG4. There were no significant associations among the specific immunoglobulin deficiencies except that all IgA-deficient subjects had IgD deficiency. Thus, intrinsic penetrance is a random process independently affecting different MHC susceptibility genes. Because multiple different external triggers would be required to explain the results, differential environmental determinants appear unlikely.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression {\&} path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.},

abstract = {The NOD mouse, which spontaneously develops insulitis and overt diabetes, is a model of autoimmune type I diabetes mellitus. To analyze of the roles of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the pathogenesis of this mouse, we have been doing a series of studies on the induction of insulitis and diabetes in NOD athymic nude mice by means of T cell transfer. To complement our previous study dealing with the induction of insulitis and cyclophosphamide-induced diabetes in recipients that had been reconstituted with each T cell subset derived from the nondiabetic mice, the present study was conducted to observe the transfer of spontaneous diabetes by injecting T cells harvested from diabetic mice. Any possible in vivo increase in the contaminating T cell subset was prevented by injecting the antibody homologous to it. Transfer of untreated or complement-treated splenic lymphocytes of diabetic mice containing both T cell subsets induced spontaneous diabetes 30 to 58 days after the cell transfer as well as insulitis, while spleen cells from nondiabetic mice rarely produced diabetes. On the other hand, transfer of either CD4+ cell-depleted or CD8+ cell-depleted splenic lymphocytes of diabetic mice did not cause diabetes at least up to 60 days after the cell transfer. Also, transfer of only the CD4+ T cell-depleted fraction did not cause insulitis. In contrast, transfer of only the CD8+ T cell-depleted fraction induced insulitis in all the recipients. However, insulitis was less potent in this group of mice than in the diabetic recipients given both subsets: only a low insulitis score was obtained and a number of $\beta$-cells remained alive despite the insulitis in mice given the CD8+ T cell-depleted fraction, whereas islet damage was very severe and insulin-secreting $\beta$-cells were no longer detected in the diabetic mice. Thus, the present results agree with the previous ones concerning transfer of diabetes, with the aid of cyclophosphamide treatment, by T cells of nondiabetic mouse origin. Consideration of our results together with earlier findings led to the conclusion that CD4+ T cells are primarily responsible for insulitis and that CD8+ T cells migrate into islets and are differentiated into mature killer cells against $\beta$-cells with the aid of CD4+ T cells in both spontaneous and cyclophosphamide-induced diabetes.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by absolute insulin deficiency resulting from the progressive immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic islet $\beta$ cells. It is thought to be triggered by as yet unidentified environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals, the major genetic contribution coming from loci within the HLA complex, in particular HLA class II. The worldwide incidence of T1D varies by at least 100-fold, being highest in Finland and Sardinia (Italy) and lowest in Venezuela and China. The incidence has been increasing worldwide at an annual rate of approximately 3%. While genetic factors are thought to explain some of the geographic variability in T1D occurrence, they cannot account for its rapidly increasing frequency. Instead, the declining proportion of newly diagnosed children with high-risk genotypes suggests that environmental pressures are now able to trigger T1D in genotypes that previously would not have developed the disease during childhood. Although comparisons between countries and regions with low and high-incidence rates have suggested that higher socioeconomic status and degree of urbanization are among the environmental factors that play a role in the rising incidence of T1D, the findings are too inconsistent to allow firm conclusions. Morbidity and mortality as well as causes of death also show considerable geographic variation. While glycemic control has been identified as a major predictor of the micro- and macrovascular complications of T1D and shows considerable geographical variability, it does not appear to be the only factor involved in the regional differences in complication rates. The role of genetics in susceptibility to nephropathy, retinopathy and other diabetic complications largely remains to be explored.},

abstract = {The range of possible gene interactions in a multilocus model of a complex inherited disease is studied by exploring genotype-specific risks subject to the constraint that the allele frequencies and marginal risks are known. We quantify the effect of gene interactions by defining the interaction ratio, CR=KR/KRI, where KR is the recurrence risk to relatives with relationship R for the true model and KRI is the recurrence risk to relatives for a multiplicative model with the same marginal risks. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure to sample from the space of possible models. We find that the average of CR increases with the number of loci for both low frequency (p=0.03) and higher frequency (p=0.25) causative alleles. Furthermore, the probability that CR>1 is nearly 1. Similar results are obtained when more weight is given to risk models that are closer to the comparable multiplicative model. These results imply that, in general, gene interactions will result in greater heritability of a complex inherited disease than is expected on the basis of a multiplicative model of interactions and hence may provide a partial explanation for the problem of missing heritability of complex diseases.},

While the target antigens are unknown, there is clearly a lack of tolerance to them. Neonatal intrathymic (i.t.) antigen injection has been successfully employed to prevent insulitis in BB rats but previous i.t. islet antigen studies in NOD mice were done on older mice. We have injected syngeneic islets into the thymus of NOD mice at birth and found that diabetes and insulitis can be completely prevented by this procedure. The effect is islet antigen-specific since other T cell responses, including autoimmune salivary infiltration, are unaffected. Furthermore, contrary to previous studies, cyclophosphamide administration was unable to induce diabetes in treated mice which suggests that deletion or anergy might be the mechanism by which neonatal intrathymic islet injection protects from disease. However, anti-islet antigen antibodies were still present in these mice which suggests that the mechanism of disease protection may be more complex.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies represent a powerful approach to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined approximately 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of approximately 3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P < 5 x 10(-7): 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10(-5) and 5 x 10(-7)) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research.},

In the current report we reduce the size of the Idd9.3 interval to 1.2{\&}{\#}xa0;Mb containing 15 genes, including one encoding the immune signaling molecule, 4-1BB, which shows amino acid variation between diabetes sensitive and resistant strains. 4-1BB, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily expressed by a variety of immune cells, mediates growth and survival signals for T cells. Functional analyses demonstrate that purified T cells from NOD congenic mice with the C57BL/10 (B10) allele at Idd9.3 produce more IL-2 and proliferate more vigorously in response to anti-CD3 plus immobilized 4-1BB ligand than T cells from NOD mice with the NOD allele at Idd9.3. In contrast, the response to anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 costimulation was indistinguishable between the congenic strains, pinpointing the differences in NOD versus NOD.B10 Idd9.3 T cell responses to the 4-1BB costimulatory pathway. These data provide evidence in support of Idd9.3 as the locus encoding 4-1BB and suggest that the 4-1BB signaling pathway could have a primary function in the etiology of autoimmune disease.},

abstract = {In this review we want to consider some of the requirements for autoimmune disease to develop and how this may be reproduced in animal models. Besides a genetic predisposition, environmental triggering factors seem to play a central role in the etiology of many autoimmune diseases. In theory, a structural similarity or identity between the host and an invading pathogen might cause the immune system of the host to react not only to the pathogen but also to self-components. However, in order for such a process of molecular mimicry to induce autoimmunity the mechanisms of maintaining tolerance or ignorance to the self-components need to be circumvented. Subsequently, in order to advance autoimmunity to overt autoimmune disease the frequency and avidity of autoaggressive lymphocytes has to be of sufficient magnitude. Intuitively, one would assume that tolerance might be stronger to identical structures than to structures that just share a certain degree of similarity. Self-reactive lymphocytes with high-avidity are more likely to be deleted or functionally silenced by central and/or peripheral tolerance mechanisms. Thus, perfect mimicry between identical structures might fail in inducing autoimmunity because of efficient tolerance mechanisms. In contrast, imperfect mimicry between similar but not identical structures might on one hand circumvent tolerance but on the other hand result in the generation of lymphocytes with only low- to intermediate avidity. Here we examine animal models that use the concept of molecular mimicry as a potential mechanism for inducing or accelerating autoimmunity. We focus on the RIP-LCMV model for type 1 diabetes and the novel cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) model for autoimmune hepatitis, which use either identical or similar triggering and target antigens.},

GLP-1, in addition to its insulinotropic action in alleviating hyperglycemia, possesses beneficial effects in protecting progressive impairment of pancreatic $\beta$-cell function, preservation of $\beta$-cell mass and suppression of glucagon secretion, gastric emptying and appetite. Preclinical data using incretin-based therapies in diabetic NOD mice demonstrated additional effects including immuno-modulation, anti-inflammation and $\beta$-cell regeneration. Thus, data accumulated hold the promise that incretin-based therapies may be effective in delaying the new-onset, halting the further progression, or reversing T1D in subjects with newly diagnosed or long-standing, established disease.},

Bone marrow transplantation as a therapy for type 1 diabetes has been explored in NOD mice. NOD mice require higher doses of conditioning irradiation for successful allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, suggesting that NOD hematopoietic cells are radioresistant compared to those of other mouse strains. However, studies of hematopoietic reconstitution in NOD mice are hampered by the lack of mice bearing a suitable cell-surface marker that would allow transferred cells or their progeny to be distinguished. In order to monitor hematopoietic reconstitution in NOD mice we generated congenic NOD mice that carry the alternative allelic form of the pan-leukocyte alloantigen CD45. Following irradiation and congenic bone marrow transplantation, we found that the myeloid lineage was rapidly reconstituted by cells of donor origin but substantial numbers of recipient T lymphocytes persisted even after supra-lethal irradiation. This indicates that radiation resistance in the NOD hematopoietic compartment is a property primarily of mature T lymphocytes.},

However, the underlying mechanisms by which CD4+Foxp3+Treg cells suppress diabetes remain unclear. Methods Seven-week-old female NOD mice were intravenously injected with GAD-IgG-transduced splenocytes. The ratio of CD80+:CD86+ cells in splenocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry. The effect of the ratio of CD80+:CD86+ cells on tolerance, diabetes prevention, and Foxp3 expression in GAD-IgG-treated NOD mice was tested by in vitro proliferation, in vivo antibody block, and semi-quantified RT-PCR, respectively. Results We found that the ratio of CD80+:CD86+ cells increased in GAD-IgG-treated NOD mice. After CD4+Treg cells were depleted from GAD-IgG-transduced splenocytes before transfer, the ratio of CD80+:CD86+ cells decreased in NOD mice recipients. The increasing ratio of CD80+:CD86+ cells was positively associated with tolerance, diabetes prevention, and the high level of Foxp3 in GAD-IgG-treated NOD mice. Conclusions These findings suggest that the high ratio of CD80+:CD86+ cells is required for the suppressive function of GAD-IgG-inducing CD4+Foxp3+Treg cells in NOD mice.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have suggested that stress precipitates type I diabetes. Because stress-elicited hyperglycemia may play a role in this effect, we measured the influence of acute immobilization (90 min) upon plasma glucose and insulin levels in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, a spontaneous model of type I diabetes. To this end, prediabetic 8-week-old mice of both sexes were compared to age- and sex-matched C57BL/6 control mice. Baseline plasma glucose levels and immobilization-elicited hyperglycemia were both lower in male and female NOD mice compared to their C57BL/6 counterparts. However, the maximal effects of immobilization upon plasma insulin (and corticosterone) levels were not different between NOD and C57BL/6 mice. When subjected to a metabolic stressor, such as 2-deoxyglucose-induced neuroglucopenia, both strains responded with similar increases in plasma glucose levels. This change was associated with hyperinsulinemia, whose amplitude was lower in NOD than in C57BL/6 females. Lastly, administration of the $\alpha$2-adrenergic agonist, clonidine, elicited a marked increase in plasma glucose levels, whose amplitude was independent of the strain. The results from this study indicate that the two strains differed in their glycemic response to a psychological, but not to a metabolic, stressor. Because NOD mice were found to exhibit increased locomotion when placed for the first time in an open field, it is suggested that behavioral differences contribute to this differential effect of immobilization upon circulating glucose levels in NOD and C57BL/6 mice.},

Two hundred seven Japanese type I diabetic patients and 160 healthy control subjects were studied in this case-control study. No significant differences of global IFNG allele frequencies were found between controls and type I diabetic patients, and between each subgroup of the patients and controls. When compared with controls, the a12 allele was increased in the patients with age at onset {\&}lt;25 years (p 0.0241, pc = 0.1205), and a significant increased frequency of the a12 positive genotype was observed in the patients with age at onset {\&}lt;25 years (pc = 0.0121). There were no differences of IL-10-592 genotype and allele frequencies between controls and type I diabetes. However, the frequency of the -592∗C allele was significantly increased in the patients with highly positive-GADab compared with controls (pc = 0.0060) or compared with the GADab-negative type I patients (pc = 0.0276). These results suggest that the IFNG CA-repeat and the IL-10-592A/C polymorphisms are not strong determinants of susceptibility to the development of type I diabetes in Japanese individuals. However, both the IFNG CA-repeat and the IL-10-592A/C polymorphisms are associated with clinical heterogeneity in type I diabetes.},

abstract = {Women pregnant with a male fetus often generate cellular and humoral immune responses against male-specific minor histocompatibility (HY) antigens---however, the importance of these responses for pregnancy outcome is unclear. Epidemiologic studies have shown that the birth of a boy compared with a girl prior to a series of miscarriages significantly reduces the chance of a subsequent live birth and pregnancies with boys have an increased risk of placental abruption. This paper aims to review the current knowledge about the impact of anti-HY immunity on pregnancy outcome in terms of miscarriage and placental abruption. Our knowledge primarily comes from studies of the impact on pregnancy outcome of HLA class II alleles known to restrict CD4 T cell mediated anti-HY responses among 358 secondary recurrent miscarriage (SRM) patients and 203 of their children born prior to the miscarriages and investigation of these HLA alleles in 8 patients with recurrent severe placental abruptions. The chance of a subsequent live birth in SRM patients with firstborn boys compared to firstborn girls was significantly lower in women with HY-restricting HLA class II alleles [OR: 0.17 (0.1--0.4), p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.0001]. Most patients with recurrent placental abruptions had firstborn boys and significantly more of these patients carried HLA haplotypes with HY-restricting class II alleles compared with controls (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.009). These findings are strongly indicative of aberrant maternal immune reactions against fetal HY antigens playing a role in recurrent miscarriage and placental abruption. We propose pathogenetic pathways for these conditions that in our view best explain the findings.},

abstract = {Pancreatic islet transplantation has the potential to maintain normoglycemia in patients with established type 1 diabetes, thereby obviating the need for frequent insulin injections. Our previous study showed that recombinant IL-12p40-producing islets prevented the recurrence of NOD diabetes. First, to see which immunomodulating molecule-secreting islet grafts can most powerfully prevent diabetes development in NOD mice without immunosuppressant, NOD islets were transfected with one of the following adenoviral vectors: Ad.IL-12p40, Ad.TGF-$\beta$, Ad.CTLA4-Ig, or Ad.TNF-$\alpha$ after which they were transplanted under the renal capsule of acutely diabetic NOD mice. The immunomodulating molecules produced by these adenovirus-transfected islets in vitro were 74{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;19{\&}{\#}xa0;ng, 50{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;4{\&}{\#}xa0;ng, 821{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;31{\&}{\#}xa0;ng, and 77{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;18{\&}{\#}xa0;ng/100 islets, respectively. Transplantation of IL-12p40, TNF-$\alpha$, and CTLA4-Ig but not TGF-$\beta$-secreting islets displayed enhanced survival and delayed diabetes recurrence in recent-onset diabetic recipients. IL-12p40-producing islet grafts most powerfully prevented recurrent diabetes in NOD mice. In addition, local production of TNF-$\alpha$ and CTLA4-Ig significantly prolonged islet graft survival. In second series of experiment, these manipulated islets were transplanted under the renal capsule of 10-week-old NOD recipients and were also transplanted subcutaneously into 2-week-old NOD recipients. Transplantation of these islets into 2- or 10-week-old pre-diabetic mice failed to protect them from developing diabetes; in fact, transplantation of Ad.TNF-$\alpha$-transfected islets into 2-week-old mice actually accelerated diabetes onset. Taken together, this approach was ineffectual as a prophylactic protocol. In conclusion, this study showed comparisons of the immunomodulating effects of 4 different adenoviral vectors in the same transplantation model and local production of IL-12p40, TNF-$\alpha$ and CTLA4-Ig significantly prevented recurrent diabetes in NOD mice.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of the insulin producing pancreatic $\beta$-cells. For years, the notion that T-lymphocytes played a crucial role in the disorder's formation was considered such sound dogma, that interest in B-lymphocytes and autoantibodies as pathogenic variables was largely relegated to second-class status. However, much of our knowledge regarding the pathogenesis and natural history of this disease has been afforded by analysis of subjects having type 1 diabetes associated autoantibodies. While autoantibodies to more than two dozen autoantigens have been associated with this disease, a majority of interest has been directed at four autoantibodies; islet cell cytoplasmic (ICA), insulin (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA), and IA2/ICA512 autoantigen (IA2A). These autoantibodies, combined with other metabolic and genetic markers, are extremely effective for predicting eventual development of type 1 diabetes in otherwise healthy individuals. These autoantibodies have also aided in our understanding of disease heterogeneity and suggest that the autoimmune processes underlying type 1 diabetes initiate in the earliest stages of life (e.g., initial autoantibody formation at 9--18 months of age). Additional improvements are needed to more accurately define the time to disease onset, response to therapeutic intervention, the pathogenic features of the autoimmune response, and perhaps even the quantity of residual beta cell function.},

PLP inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-$\gamma$, IL-2, and TNF-$\alpha$ by Th1 cells and macrophages, but up-regulated IL-4 expression by Th2 cells in NOD mice. PLP did not prevent streptozotocin-induced diabetic development in ICR mice.

We wished to determine if well controlled human and mice with type 1 diabetes had iatrogenic hyperinsulinemia as an explanation for the increased rate of coronary artery disease (CAD) in type 1 diabetes. Methods Type 1 diabetic subjects with HbA1C less than 7.0% had plasma insulin measured before and one hour after a Boost{\textregistered} challenge and a dose of subcutaneously administered insulin. These levels were compared with non-diabetic humans. Plasma insulin levels in well controlled NOD mice with type 1 diabetes were measured 3{\&}{\#}xa0;h and 17{\&}{\#}xa0;h after their usual dose of insulin. Hepatic cholesterol-relevant CAD and inflammation markers were measured in the NOD mice. Result Marked iatrogenic hyperinsulinemia was observed in patients at levels of approximately two times higher than in non-diabetic controls. Similar findings were present in the NOD mice. Hepatic CAD risk markers were increased by insulin, but did not exceed normal expression levels in non-diabetic mice with lower insulin. In contrast, insulin-mediated stimulation of pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$ remained significantly higher in hyperinsulinemic NOD than non-diabetic mice. Conclusion Optimal insulin therapy in mice and humans with type 1 diabetes causes iatrogenic hyperinsulinemia and subsequently promotes pro-inflammatory macrophage response independent of hepatic cholesterol-relevant CAD markers. The tight glycemic control in type 1 diabetes may thus increase the risk for atherogenesis via inflammation.},

abstract = {Regulatory T cells (Treg) reportedly suppress diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, and the frequency and functional suppressive properties of Treg were found to be upregulated by inhibition of Ras. We thus postulated that treatment with the Ras inhibitor 5-fluoro-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (F-FTS), a derivative of S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS), would attenuate diabetes development in NOD mice. To test this hypothesis we assayed Foxp3, total Ras, and GTP-Ras in NOD splenocytes following their exposure to FTS and F-FTS in vitro. In splenocytes exposed to FTS, and even more so to F-FTS, Foxp3 expression was increased and GTP-Ras expression reduced. We also injected NOD mice intraperitoneally with F-FTS and assessed both their Treg pools and the occurrence of diabetes. The treated mice showed a significant increase in the frequency of spleen-cell-derived Foxp3+ Treg, and their Treg were more effective than Treg from untreated NOD controls in suppressing the proliferation of effector T cells. Moreover, the F-FTS treatment also attenuated the development of diabetes in the NOD mice. The mice were then killed and their insulin and cytokine levels assayed. The treated mice showed an increase in circulating insulin but no change in cytokine concentrations. One of the mechanisms underlying our novel finding that treatment with a Ras inhibitor ameliorates the development of experimental type-1 diabetes could thus conceivably be an augmentation in the frequency and functional suppressive properties of Treg. Ras inhibition might therefore be worth developing as a new treatment modality in patients with type 1 diabetes.},

abstract = {During the last 25 years the concept of a chronic autoimmune process leading to the development of insulin dependent diabetes (IDD) has emerged. The presence of two animal models for IDD, the BB rat and the NOD mouse, has improved our ability to understand the process leading to $\beta$ cell destruction. The hallmark of an autoimmune disease is the characteristic pathologic lesion of mononuclear infitration of the pancreatic islets. Further histologic studies of the diabetic pancreas have identified the type of cells infiltrating the islets and led to the concept of pancreatic $\beta$ cells capable of presenting antigen. The initial description of linkage disequilibrium of HLA DR3 and DR4 alleles with IDD has now progressed to the molecular level with the identification of residue 57 of the HLA DQ $\beta$ chain as crucial to the genetic predisposition to IDD. Autoantibodies to cytoplasmic antigens (ICA), surface antigens, or a membrane protein of 64 kDa identified by immunoprecipitation, autoantibodies to secreted products such as insulin and proinsulin, and autoantibodies that are cytotoxic to cultured $\beta$ cells are islet specific autoantibodies that have been described. Some are probably only markers of immunologic activity; others might participate in the destruction itself. The use of ICA as a screening tool has been successful in identifying individuals prior to the onset of IDD. Widespread cellular immunological defects have been identified both in animal models and in man. In the BB rat, a seeming paradox of severe immunodeficiency occurs in an animal with autoaggressive destruction of $\beta$ cells. More subtle defects in immuno-regulation have been described in the NOD mouse and in human IDD. The response of IDD in both animal models and in man to immunomodulation and to immunosuppression offers further evidence of an immunologically mediated disease. However, some therapies in the animal models, not typically considered immunologic, such as protein restriction and insulin therapy, have prevented IDD. The possibility of intervening prior to the onset of clinical disease at the level either of the initial process of recognition of the pancreatic $\beta$ cell as a target organ or of the effector mechanism is approaching a reality in human IDD.},

Here we examined the effect of repeated injections of IL-15 on the development of diabetes in NOD mice. Injection of recombinant murine IL-15, once a day for 2 weeks, neither inhibited nor accelerated diabetes development in untreated NOD mice. However, treatment with IL-15 significantly reduced the incidence and delayed the onset of diabetes in NOD mice that were depleted of NK cells, while NK cell depletion alone had no protection against the disease development. The protective effect in IL-15-treated, NK cell-depleted NOD mice was associated with an increase in immunosuppressive activity of CD4+CD25+ Tregs. IL-15 also enhanced Foxp3 expression in CD4+CD25+ cells in an in vitro culture system, and such an effect of IL-15 was abrogated by IL-15-activated NK cells. Inhibition of IL-15-induced Foxp3 expression by IL-15-activated NK cells likely resulted from their IFN-$\gamma$ production, as recombinant IFN-$\gamma$, or the culture supernatant of IL-15-activated wild-type mouse NK cells but not of IL-15-activated IFN-$\gamma$-deficient NK cells, mediated a similar inhibition. IFN-$\gamma$ also diminished the stimulatory effect of IL-15 on Treg function in vitro. These results indicate that IL-15 has the potential to promote Treg function and protect against diabetes development in NOD mice, but such an activity can be eliminated by simultaneous activation of NK cells in IL-15-treated mice.},

abstract = {Chromatin supraorganization and extensibility and nuclear glycoprotein content have been reported to change in hepatocytes from mice during development and aging, as well as under starvation and refeeding conditions. In non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, the expression of insulin-dependent diabetes may be accompanied by metabolic changes in the liver. These changes are likely to be similar to those involved in the aging processes of non-diabetic animals. Therefore, we hypothesized that the chromatin organization, as well as the physical properties and compositions of hepatocyte nuclei would also be affected in NOD mice in the same way as those in aged non-diabetic mice. Nuclear image parameters were evaluated by image analysis of Feulgen-stained preparations. Chromatin extensibility in response to gravity was observed with polarized light after lysis and toluidine blue staining. The Con-A response of nuclear glycoproteins was evaluated with scanning microspectrophotometry. These charateristics were assessed using hepatocyte imprints from female NOD mice after a 28-day period of diabetes expression. Observations and measurements were made in comparison to healthy BALB/c mice. Total RNA amounts were determined for livers of NOD and BALB/c mice. Enhanced polyploidy levels, a decrease in chromatin higher-order packing states, an increased frequency of extended chromatin fiber formation, and deeper Con-A-responsive chromatin areas were observed in the hepatocytes of the NOD mice expressing insulin-dependent diabetes. Reduced amounts of total RNA were also found in the livers of these mice. Our findings for NOD mice expressing insulin-dependent diabetes are consistent with previously reported data for old-aged mice of the inbred strain A/Uni and may reflect changes in transcriptional activities associated with the stressful physiological demands on the liver during the expression of diabetes.},

The $\alpha$-chain encoded by the IL2RA (CD25) gene is a substantial component of the high-affinity receptor molecule highly expressed by activated T lymphocytes. Recently, a strong evidence was obtained for the involvement of IL-2RA in conferring susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Significant association with T1D was also found in the region on chromosome 4q27 containing the IL2 gene and homologous to the susceptibility locus idd3 in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an animal model for human T1D. Here we focus on the discussion of these new findings suggesting for a crucial role of IL-2/IL-2RA-mediated regulatory mechanisms in preventing T1D. The non-redundant role of IL-2 and its receptor in etiology of T1D could be particularly attributable to the regulation of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells, whose function is critical in maintaining immune homeostasis.},

One hundred one Japanese patients and 110 healthy control subjects were studied. The frequency of A4 allele was significantly higher and that of A6 allele was significantly lower in patients than in control subjects. The frequency of A5.1 allele was highest in early-onset patients (23.0%), intermediate in intermediate-onset patients (9.2%) and lowest in late-onset patients (7.7%) (trend chi-squared test, p = 0.0098). A5.1 allele was strongly associated with HLA-B7 and Cw7, suggesting that MICA∗A5.1-B7-Cw7 haplotype contains a gene responsible for age-at-onset. A4 allele was associated with a susceptible haplotype, DR4-DQB1∗0401, and A6 allele was associated with a protective haplotype, DR2-DQB1∗0601, suggesting that the association of MICA with type 1 diabetes susceptibility may be due to linkage disequilibrium with class II haplotypes. These data suggest that MICA gene is associated with age-at-onset and that a gene (or genes) responsible for age-at-onset of type 1 diabetes is located in the HLA class I region, probably near the region of MICA-B-C.},

abstract = {Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is sometimes associated with extrapancreatic organ-specific autoimmune diseases, but whether this phenotype results from a peculiar genetic profile is still unclear. The allelic distribution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes (HLA-DRB1, DQA1, DQB1 and TAP) was analysed in 143 patients with IDDM alone by comparison with 82 IDDM patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (IDDM/AITD). The frequency of the DQB1∗0301 IDDM-protective phenotype seemed to be lower in IDDM than in IDDM/AITD patients (16.8% vs 30.5% respectively, p = 0.02). By contrast, the frequency of the DRB1∗04-DQB1∗0302 IDDM-predisposing phenotype was higher in IDDM than in IDDM/AITD patients (91.3% vs 76.1% of DR4-positive patients respectively, p = 0.007), but these differences were not significant after correcting the p values, except in the case of the DRB1∗0405-DQB1∗0302 combination (21.3% vs 2.4% of DR4-positive patients, Pc = 0.05). Furthermore, all differences disappeared when patients were matched for age at IDDM-onset. Our data do not long give support for a particular role of MHC class II genes in favouring the occurence of thyroid autoimmunity in IDDM patients, but rather suggest that some class II alleles or residues might determine the rapidity of progression to IDDM in genetically susceptible individuals. The involvement of non-MHC genes and/or environmental factors remains to be determined.},

NOD mice represent a valuable tool for studying the genetics of T1D and for evaluating therapeutic interventions. Here we describe the development and characterization by end-sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries derived from NOD/MrkTac (DIL NOD) and NOD/ShiLtJ (CHORI-29), two commonly used NOD substrains. The DIL NOD library is composed of 196,032 BACs and the CHORI-29 library is composed of 110,976 BACs. The average depth of genome coverage of the DIL NOD library, estimated from mapping the BAC end-sequences to the reference mouse genome sequence, was 7.1-fold across the autosomes and 6.6-fold across the X chromosome. Clones from this library have an average insert size of 150 kb and map to over 95.6% of the reference mouse genome assembly (NCBIm37), covering 98.8% of Ensembl mouse genes. By the same metric, the CHORI-29 library has an average depth over the autosomes of 5.0-fold and 2.8-fold coverage of the X chromosome, the reduced X chromosome coverage being due to the use of a male donor for this library. Clones from this library have an average insert size of 205 kb and map to 93.9% of the reference mouse genome assembly, covering 95.7% of Ensembl genes. We have identified and validated 191,841 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for DIL NOD and 114,380 SNPs for CHORI-29. In total we generated 229,736,133 bp of sequence for the DIL NOD and 121,963,211 bp for the CHORI-29. These BAC libraries represent a powerful resource for functional studies, such as gene targeting in NOD embryonic stem (ES) cell lines, and for sequencing and mapping experiments.},

The CTS mouse had the same allele as the NOD mouse at the Hsp70 locus, but different alleles at the Bat5, Tnfa and Tnfb loci from those of the NOD mouse. Our previous studies indicated that in the CTS mouse, class II MHC was the same as that of the NOD mouse, but that class I MHC was different at both K and D loci, and that CTS MHC was diabetogenic in the presence of NOD background genes. These data map major genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes to the segment flanked by class I K and class III Bat5 loci. Moreover, since the diabetogenic effect of the CTS MHC is weaker than that of the NOD MHC, these data suggest the presence of a second MHC-linked gene or gene complexes that modulate susceptibility to type 1 diabetes outside this segment.},

The aim of this study was to investigate age-related changes of T$\gamma$$\delta$ cells during diabetes development in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Using FACS analysis relative numbers of T$\gamma$$\delta$+ cells from thymus, blood and spleen were determined in 3-week-old non-diabetic, at onset of diabetes, and 1-week diabetic NOD mice and corresponding BALB/cJ controls. In comparison to BALB/cJ mice, higher values (2.4 $\pm$ 0.2% vs. 1.1 $\pm$ 0.1%) were found in the thymus of 3-week-old NOD mice (P {\&}lt; 0.01) as well as in spleens of 22-week-old littermates (1.1 $\pm$ 0.1% vs. 0.6 $\pm$ 0.1%, P {\&}lt; 0.01). In addition, a higher proportion of T$\gamma$$\delta$ cells was observed in blood samples of all age groups of NOD as compared to BALB/cJ mice, with values 3.5 $\pm$ 0.7% (P {\&}lt; 0.05) in 3-week-old to 4.4 $\pm$ 0.9% and 3.7 $\pm$ 0.3% (P {\&}lt; 0.01) in 16- and 22-week-old NOD littermates. Differences in TCR$\gamma$$\delta$ expression did not influence the whole CD3+ subset of mononuclear cells. Thus, our results show relatively higher numbers of T$\gamma$$\delta$ cells in NOD mice and their increase in the periphery at onset of diabetes and later may suggest that T$\gamma$$\delta$ cells participate in $\beta$-cell destruction.},

abstract = {Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has recently been performed as a novel strategy to treat patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the mechanism of autologous HSCT-induced remission of diabetes remains unknown. In order to help clarify the mechanism of remission-induction following autologous HSCT in patients with T1D, mice treated with multiple low doses of streptozotocin to induce diabetes were used as both donors (n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;20) and recipients (n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;20). Compared to streptozocin-treated mice not receiving transplantation, syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (syn-BMT) from a streptozocin-treated diabetic donor, if applied during new-onset T1D (day 10 after diabetes onset), can reverse hyperglycemia without relapse (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.001), maintain normal blood insulin levels (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.001), and preserve islet cell mass. Compared to diabetic mice not undergoing HSCT, syn-BMT, results in restoration of Tregs in spleens (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.01), increased Foxp3 mRNA expression (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.01) and increased Foxp3 protein expression (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05). This diabetic-remission-inducing effect occurred in mice receiving bone marrow from either streptozocin-treated diabetic or non-diabetic normal donors. We conclude that autologous HSCT remission of diabetes is more than transient immune suppression, and is capable of prolonged remission-induction via regeneration of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs.},

The 195Dyn mimotope was detected in human islets. The screening of a $\lambda$gt11 cDNA library from human islets has identified a clone, which corresponded to human importin beta. ELISA detected autoantibodies against this protein in sera of around 60% of TD1 patients and in 30% of patients affected by other autoimmune diseases. In summary, RPLs technology proved again successful in identifying another novel autoantigen (importin beta), whose significance in the autoimmune process remains to be fully elucidated.},

abstract = {Successful vaccine development for infectious diseases has largely been achieved in settings where natural immunity to the pathogen results in clearance in at least some individuals. HIV presents an additional challenge in that natural clearance of infection does not occur, and the correlates of immune protection are still uncertain. However, partial control of viremia and markedly different outcomes of disease are observed in HIV-infected persons. Here, we examine the antiviral mechanisms implicated by one variable that has been consistently associated with extremes of outcome, namely HLA class I alleles, and in particular HLA-B, and examine the mechanisms by which this modulation is likely to occur and the impact of these interactions on evolution of the virus and the host. Studies to date provide evidence for both HLA-dependent and epitope-dependent influences on viral control and viral evolution and have important implications for the continued quest for an effective HIV vaccine.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is perceived as a chronic immune-mediated disease with a subclinical prodromal period characterized by selective loss of insulin-producing $\beta$-cells in the pancreatic islets in genetically susceptible subjects. Autoreactive T cells, both CD4 and CD8 cells, have been implicated as active players in $\beta$-cell destruction. A series of autoantigens have been identified in T1D including insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the protein tyrosine phosphatase-related islet antigen 2 (IA-2), and most recently the zinc transporter Slc30A8 residing in the insulin secretory granule of the $\beta$-cell. The issue whether there is any primary autoantigen in T1D has remained controversial. Given that there are two major HLA haplotypes conferring disease susceptibility, i.e. the DR3--DQ2 haplotype and the DR4--DQ8 haplotype, one may assume that there will be at least two primary antigens in T1D. The first signs of $\beta$-cell autoimmunity might appear already during the first year of life. Autoantibodies may be considered as markers of an ongoing disease process in the pancreatic islets, and they can be used for prediction of T1D in non-diabetic individuals. Autoantigen-specific T-cell responses have been detected from peripheral blood in both patients with T1D and in unaffected subjects, but a clear discrimination between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects have rarely been seen until recently.},

abstract = {Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) represents 10 to 15% of all forms of diabetes. Its incidence shows a consistent rise in all countries under survey. Evidence for autoimmunity in human T1D relies on the detection of insulitis, of islet cell antibodies, of activated $\beta$-cell-specific T lymphocytes and on the association of T1D with a restricted set of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles. However, mechanisms that initiate the failure of immune tolerance to $\beta$-cell autoantigens remain elusive in common forms of T1D. T1D commonly develop as a multifactorial disease in which environmental factors concur with a highly multigenic background. The disease is driven by the activation of T-lymphocytes against pancreatic $\beta$-cells. Several years elapse between initial triggering of the autoimmune response to $\beta$ cells, as evidenced by the appearance or islet cell autoantibodies, and the onset of clinical diabetes, defining a prediabetes stage. Active mechanisms hold back autoreactive effector T-cells in prediabetes, in particular a subset of CD4+ T-cells (Treg) and other regulatory T-cells, such as invariant NKT cells. There is evidence in experimental models that systemic or local infections can trigger autoimmune reactions to $\beta$-cells. However, epidemiological observations that have accumulated over years have failed to identify undisputable environmental factors that trigger T1D. Moreover, multiple environmental factors may intervene in the disease evolution and protective as weel as triggering environmental factors may be involved. Available models also indicate that local signals within the islets are required for full-blown diabetes to develop. Many autoantigens that are expressed by $\beta$-cells but also by the other endocrine islet cells and by neurons are recognized by lymphocytes along the development of T1D. The immune image of $\beta$-cells is that of native components of the $\beta$-cell membrane, as seen by B-lymphocytes, and of fragments of intracellular $\beta$-cell proteins in the form of peptides loaded onto class I MHC molecules on the $\beta$-cell surface and class I and class II molecules onto professional antigen presenting cells. Given the key role of T lymphocytes in T1D, the cartography of autoantigen-derived peptides that are presented to class I-restricted CD8+ T-cells and class II-restricted CD4+ T-cells is of outmost importance and is a necessary step in the development of diagnostic T-cell assays and of immunotherapy of T1D.},

abstract = {Numerous reports have demonstrated that CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) from individuals with a range of human autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, are deficient in their ability to control autologous proinflammatory responses when compared with nondiseased, control individuals. Treg dysfunction could be a primary, causal event or may result from perturbations in the immune system during disease development. Polymorphisms in genes associated with Treg function, such as IL2RA, confer a higher risk of autoimmune disease. Although this suggests a primary role for defective Tregs in autoimmunity, a link between IL2RA gene polymorphisms and Treg function has not been examined. We addressed this by examining the impact of an IL2RA haplotype associated with type 1 diabetes on Treg fitness and suppressive function. Studies were conducted using healthy human subjects to avoid any confounding effects of disease. We demonstrated that the presence of an autoimmune disease-associated IL2RA haplotype correlates with diminished IL-2 responsiveness in Ag-experienced CD4(+) T cells, as measured by phosphorylation of STAT5a, and is associated with lower levels of FOXP3 expression by Tregs and a reduction in their ability to suppress proliferation of autologous effector T cells. These data offer a rationale that contributes to the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which polymorphisms in the IL-2RA gene affect immune regulation, and consequently upon susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.},

Intervention(s) Ovulation assessed through the measurement of salivary progesterone (days 13, 18, 23, and 28 of each cycle). Main Outcome Measure(s) Proportion of ovulatory cycles. Result(s) A total of 168 and 281 menstrual cycles were studied in the T1D and control girls, respectively. Metabolic control was defined as optimal if HbA1c was {\&}lt;7.5%. The proportion of ovulatory cycles was similar in the TID and control groups (34.5% and 36.3%, respectively). Regression analyses showed that the presence of T1D did not have a statistically significant effect on the ovulatory rate. However, more ovulatory cycles were observed in girls with T1D who had optimal metabolic control compared with those who had insufficient control (51.3% vs. 29.4%). Conclusion(s) In adolescent girls, T1D did not affect the rate of ovulation. A higher ovulatory rate was observed in those with optimal control compared with those with insufficient metabolic control, but a substantial proportion of ovulatory cycles were still observed in patients with higher HbA1c levels.},

abstract = {Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a hematological emergency in which a rapid diagnosis is essential for early administration of appropriate therapy, including all-trans retinoic acid before the onset of fatal coagulopathy. Currently, the following methodologies are widely used for rapid initial diagnosis of APL: 1) identification of hypergranular leukemic promyelocytes by using classical morphology; 2) identification of cells with diffuse promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein distribution by immunofluorescence microscopy; 3) evidence of aberrant promyelocyte surface immunophenotype by conventional flow cytometry (FCM). Here, we show a method for immunofluorescent detection of PML localization using ImageStream FCM. This technique provides objective per-cell quantitative image analysis for statistically large sample sizes, enabling precise and operator-independent PML pattern recognition even in electronic and real dilution experiments up to 10% of APL cellular presence. Therefore, we evidence that this method could be helpful for rapid and objective initial diagnosis and the prompt initiation of APL treatment. {\copyright} 2012 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.},

abstract = {Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop diabetes. Ourselves and others have previously shown that oral and nasal administration of insulin or glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) suppresses development of diabetes in the NOD mouse and that this suppression appears secondary to the generation of regulatory T cells that act by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and TGF-$\beta$. In the present study, we analysed cytokine patterns associated with mucosal administration of insulin B-chain, B-chain peptide 10--24 and GAD peptide 524--543 and derived lines and clones from mucosally-treated animals. Mice were fed five times (400--600{\&}{\#}xa0;$\mu$g/feed) or nasally-treated three times (60{\&}{\#}xa0;$\mu$g/application), and 2 days after the last treatment were immunized in the footpad with the mucosally administered antigen in CFA. Primary immune responses in the popliteal lymph node were measured 10 days after immunization and lines and clones were then established from the primary cultures. There was significantly less IFN-$\gamma$production in mucosally-treated mice associated with increased production of IL-10 and TGF-$\beta$. The nature of the antigen appeared to determine cytokine production as the B-chain given either orally or nasally primed for TGF-$\beta$ responses, whereas mucosally administered B-chain peptide 10--24 primed for IL-10. T cell clones, established from draining lymph nodes of fed or nasally-treated animals, secreted IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-$\beta$whereas those from non-fed mice secreted IL-2 and IFN-$\gamma$. Transfer of Th1 lines with splenocytes from diabetic NOD mice into NOD or NOD/SCID animals accelerated diabetes, whereas transfer of Th2 lines suppressed the development of diabetes. Our results further support a role for Th2-type cells in the regulation of diabetes in NOD mice.},

The study of the production of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase derivatives of arachidonic acid metabolism shows that in some conditions, and in particular in the presence of zymosan A, macrophages from NOD mice produced significantly more 6-keto-prostaglandin F1$\alpha$ (6-keto-PGF1$\alpha$) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) than macrophages from age- and sex-matched C57BL6 mice. Moreover, zymosan A-stimulated macrophages from NOD females produced significantly more LTC4 than did macrophages from NOD males.

The pathogenic effects of IL-21 are partly due to its ability to promote the generation of TH-17 cells. Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF4) is a crucial regulator of IL-17 and IL-21 production. We recently found that the serine-threonine kinase ROCK2 phosphorylates IRF4 and regulates its ability to control IL-17 and IL-21 production. Here we show that NOD T cells aberrantly activate ROCK2. We furthermore demonstrate that ROCK inhibition corrects the abnormal IRF4 function in NOD T cells and diminishes their production of IL-17 and IL-21. Importantly, administration of a ROCK inhibitor to NOD mice protects against diabetes development. These studies thus support the idea that ROCK2 is inappropriately activated in NOD T cells and that ROCK kinases could represent important therapeutic targets for the treatment of T1D.},

Donor-specific tolerance can also be induced by BMT; however, clinical application of nonmyeloablative conditioning prior to BMT may be essential for reducing transplant-related toxicity and mortality. In this study, we have attempted to treat autoimmunity using a new nonmyeloablative regimen for BMT. Materials and methods Naı̈ve NOD were irradiated with 650 cGy and injected intravenously (IV) with splenocytes from overtly diabetic NOD mice for induction of diabetes mellitus. Three days later, experimental mice received allogeneic C57BL/6 or (C57BL/6 × BALB/c) F1 bone marrow (BM) cells IV for intentional activation of donor-reactive cells, and 24 hours later intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (CY) for selective depletion of alloreactive cells. In order to induce chimerism, recipients were given a second IV inoculum of donor BM 1 day after CY. Results Our method of nonmyeloablative BMT converted recipients to full or to mixed chimeras and prevented development of diabetes. Although NOD mice treated with 200 mg/kg CY died of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), we observed diabetes-free survival for {\&}gt;300 days in 90% of C57BL/6 → NOD BM chimeras treated with 60 mg/kg CY. Conclusion Our data show that allogeneic BMT after reduced-intensity conditioning based on deletion of activated donor-reactive host cells by means low-dose CY results in prevention of autoimmune diabetes by converting recipients to stable, GVHD-free BM chimeras.},

abstract = {Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, regulates immune responses through competing with receptors of Fas ligand (FasL), LIGHT and TNF-like molecule 1A (TL1A). We have previously demonstrated that transgenic expression of DcR3 in a $\beta$ cell-specific manner significantly protects non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice from autoimmune diabetes. In this study, we further investigated the systemic effect of DcR3 in regulating lymphocytes and dendritic cells in NOD mice. Our results demonstrated that both DcR3 plasmid and protein treatments significantly inhibited insulitis and diabetes. Lymphocytes from DcR3.Fc-treated mice revealed less proliferative potential and transferred ameliorated diabetes. By administration of DcR3.Fc in T1 and T2 double transgenic NOD mice expressing human Thy1 or murine Thy1.1 surface marker under IFN-$\gamma$ or IL-4 promoter control respectively, we observed a remarkable reduction of Th1 and an increase of Th2 immune responses in vivo. Strikingly, in vitro polarization experiments exhibited that not only Th1 but also Th17 cell differentiation was significantly inhibited in splenocytes treated with DcR3.Fc protein. However, this phenomenon was only observed in splenocytes, not in purified CD4+ T cells, suggesting that DcR3-mediated inhibition of Th1 and Th17 differentiation is not T cell-autonomous and maybe through other cell types such as dendritic cells. Finally, our results demonstrated that DcR3 directly modulates the differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells and subsequently regulates the differentiation and effector function of T cells.},

abstract = {Pancreatic $\beta$-cell apoptosis is important in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus. We investigated whether Humanin, a recently described survival factor for neurons, could improve the survival of $\beta$-cells and delay or treat diabetes in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) model. Humanin reduced apoptosis induced by serum starvation in NIT-1 cells and decreased apoptosis induced by cytokine treatment. Humanin induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and extracellular signal--regulated kinase phosphorylation over a 24-hour time course. Specific inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 resulted in nullifying the protective effect of Humanin. Humanin normalized glucose tolerance in NOD mice treated for 6 weeks, and their pancreata revealed decreased lymphocyte infiltration and severity. In addition, Humanin delayed/prevented the onset of diabetes in NOD mice treated for 20 weeks. In summary, Humanin treatment decreases cytokine-induced apoptosis in $\beta$-cells in vitro and improved glucose tolerance and onset of diabetes in NOD mice in vivo. This indicates that Humanin may be useful for islet protection and survival in a spectrum of diabetes-related therapeutics.},

abstract = {Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice display a syndrome with dramatic clinical and pathological features similar to Type 1 diabetes in man. Mononuclear cells intensively infiltrate the pancreas (insulitis), mostly T cells taking part. However, the functional role and specificity of these cells are currently uncertain. We investigated the response of splenic T cells from NOD mice to islet cells, using interleukin 2 (IL-2) production and cell proliferation. Splenic T cells from NOD mice responded with IL-2 production and proliferation when both islet cell antigens from NOD mice and mitomycin C-treated spleen cells (source of antigen-presenting cells) from NOD mice or major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-compatible ILI mice were present. Splenic T cells could produce IL-2 in response to islet cells from sources other than the NOD mouse, but could not produce significantly this lymphokine in response to submandibular gland, gastric mucosal, liver, spleen, and ovarian cells from NOD mice. NOD T cells produced this antigen-specific response first when the mice were 8 weeks old, the response grew stronger until 20 weeks of age and then tapered off. The present study indicates the presence of T cells specific for islet cell antigens in the spleen of NOD mice and suggests that the antigen-specific T cell response increases in parallel with the development of insulitis.},

abstract = {The initial immune process that triggers autoimmune $\beta$ cell destruction in type 1 diabetes is not fully understood. In early infancy there is an increased $\beta$ cell turnover. Recurrent exposure of tissue-specific antigens could lead to primary sensitization of immune cells in the draining lymph nodes of the pancreas. An initial immune injury to the $\beta$ cells can be inflicted by several cell types, primarily macrophages and T cells. Subsequently, infiltrating macrophages transfer antigens exposed by apoptotic $\beta$ cells to the draining lymph nodes, where antigen presenting cells process and amplify a secondary immune reaction. Antigen presenting cells evolve as dual players in the activation and suppression of the autoimmune reaction in the draining lymph nodes. We propose a scenario where destructive insulitis is caused by recurrent exposure of specific antigens due to the physiological turnover of $\beta$ cells. This sensitization initiates the evolution of reactive clones that remain silent in the regional lymph nodes, where they succeed to evade regulatory clonal deletion.},

Restriction fragment length polymorphisms were used to follow the segregation of allelic T-cell receptor $\alpha$ complexes within the families. The segregation of T-cell receptor $\alpha$ alleles in 29 multiplex families revealed no significant tendency for affected sibs to share T-cell receptor $\alpha$-chain alleles more often than would be expected by chance alone (p {\&}gt; 0.2). In contrast, the same type of analysis for HLA alleles easily detected the well-known linkage of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus susceptibility to the HLA complex (p = 0.003). We suggest that the importance of HLA alleles in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus susceptibility and the lack of importance of T-cell receptor $\alpha$ alleles result from the different strategies by which HLA and T-cell receptor molecules achieve antigen-binding diversity: multiple loci and allelic diversity in the case of HLA; combinatorial, junctional, and N-region diversity in the case of the T-cell receptor. In this paper we also describe three new restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the T-cell receptor $\alpha$ complex and a new method for testing the significance of linkage in multiple-affected-sib studies.},

Epidemiological data have established a link between vitamin D deficiency and an increased incidence of both T1D and T2D, whereas early and long-term vitamin D supplementation may decrease the risk of these disorders. The protective effects of vitamin D are mediated through the regulation of several components such as the immune system and calcium homeostasis. However, an increasing amount of evidence suggests that vitamin D also affects beta cells directly thereby rendering them more resistant to the types of cellular stress encountered during T1D and T2D. This review evaluates the role of vitamin D signaling in the pathogenesis of T1D and T2D with a special emphasis on the direct effects of vitamin D on pancreatic beta cells.},

The HLA-DR3 and DR4 alleles are considered high risk factors for T1D and TCD40 expansion occurs in T1D subjects carrying HLA DR3 or DR4 haplotypes but, T1D subjects who do not carry either DR3 or DR4 haplotypes still have an expanded percentage of TCD40 cells. Non-autoimmune subjects, even DR3+ and DR4+, do not have elevated percentages of TCD40 cells. The majority of TCD40 cells in T1D carry a memory phenotype and a portion of those proliferates when exposed to diabetes-associated self-antigens. A greater number of memory TCD40 cells express CXCR3 when compared to CD40− memory cells and that number is significantly expanded in T1D compared to control subjects. If only total CD4+ T cells are compared no difference in CXCR3 is seen. Furthermore, TCD40 cells produce a Th1, pro-inflammatory cytokine profile. In healthy controls, TCD40 cells have equally Th1 and Th2 profiles.},

abstract = {Background. Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice develop a systemic autoimmune disease that resembles type I diabetes in human beings. Previous studies in NOD mice have shown that transplantation of bone marrow from normal donors to lethally conditioned recipients prevented the development of diabetes (B10.BR→NOD, BALB/c→NOD). The focus of the present study was to examine whether donor-specific transplantation tolerance for islet allografts could be achieved if islet transplantations were performed coincident with the time of bone marrow infusion in diabetic NOD mice. Moreover, the transplanted islets were evaluated for evidence of recurrent autoimmunity. Methods. Female NOD mice were followed until autoimmune diabetes occurred (urine glucose, +++ to ++++; blood glucose level, 300 mg/dl or greater). Diabetic NOD mice were irradiated with 950 cGy total body irradiation and received 30×106 untreated B10.BR bone marrow cells (B10.BR→NOD). A simultaneous islet allograft was placed under the renal capsule within 24 hours after infusion of the bone marrow cells. Mice were monitored by means of blood glucose levels, and histologic analyses were performed on the transplanted islet. Results. Islet allografts genetically matched to the bone marrow donor were significantly prolonged (n=5; mean survival time, 206 days or more) and showed no evidence for chronic rejection or recurrent insulitis, whereas major histocompatibility complex-disparate third-party allografts were rejected (n=3; mean survival time, 37 days) and exhibited lymphocytic infiltration compatible with rejection on histologic evaluation. Conclusions. These data suggest that permanent donor-specific tolerance to islet allografts placed simultaneously with bone marrow transplantation can be achieved in diabetic NOD mice. Moreover, recurrent autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic tissue is prevented by the bone marrow chimerism.},

Accumulating evidence indicates that diabetes, regardless of its type, impairs adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus (HPC). However, the effects of the disease on neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) are not well established. We induced diabetes in male NOD/SCID (non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency) mice and C57BL/6 mice with a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). On day 7 or day 21 after STZ injection mice received the thymidine analog 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for labeling of proliferative cells. Mice were sacrificed 24{\&}{\#}xa0;h later and brain coronal sections were stained with anti-BrdU antibodies. Neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC/NPC) proliferation, as revealed by BrdU-labeled cells, was markedly decreased in the subgranular zone of the DG in STZ-treated diabetic mice. A similar reduction of NSC/NPC proliferation was seen in the SVZ. Reduced DG and SVZ cell proliferation was also found in diabetic NOD mice, a model of spontaneous diabetes, and the reduction was attenuated by bilateral adrenalectomy (Adx). Adx did not alter blood glucose or insulin levels in either prediabetic or diabetic NOD mice, but Adx partly increased mRNA levels of hippocampal and SVZ brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a crucial regulator of NSC/NPC proliferation. Moreover, NOD and NOD/SCID mice showed a more rapid reduction of NSC/NPC proliferation than C57BL/6 mice in response to diabetes. Thus, we conclude that diabetes inhibits cell proliferation in both the SVZ and HPC, and inhibition was associated with elevated glucocorticoid levels and reduced BDNF expression.},

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (i.e., CD3 + T-lymphocyte subsets), the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, and the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) are key factors involved in T-cell---mediated immune surveillance. The present study was designed to assess the expression pattern of intratumoral lymphocyte infiltrates and their relationship to HLA class I and ICAM-1 expression with regard to primary esophageal carcinoma and to evaluate their prognostic influence. Representative samples of primary tumors were obtained from 55 patients who had undergone radical en bloc esophagectomy. Frozen sections of these tumors were stained with monoclonal antibodies directed against CD3 for the assessment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, HLA class I, and ICAM-1. The mean postoperative observation period was 19.5 months (range 5 to 45 months). Lymphocyte infiltration was absent in four tumors (8%), whereas 31 tumors (64%) showed moderate and 13 (27%) showed strong infiltration. HLA class I expression was deficient in 24 tumors (45%). Coexpression of HLA class I and ICAM-1 was significantly associated with lymphocyte infiltration of the tumor. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed a significant beneficial influence on relapse-free survival for patients with lymphocyte infiltration of primary tumors compared to those with no lymphocyte infiltration of tumors (median 4 months vs. 18 months; P {\&}lt;0.002) and for HLA class I+ tumors compared to HLA class I− tumors (median survival {\&}gt; 18 months vs. 7 months; P = 0.0081). The present data support the hypothesis that T-cell---mediated immunity may influence the fate of patients with esophageal cancer.},

abstract = {Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a hematological malignancy of the immune system, and, as with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (ADs), is influenced by genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Persons with a history of specific ADs also have increased risk of NHL. As the coexistence of ADs and NHL could be caused by factors common to both diseases, here we examined whether some of the associated genetic signals are shared. Overlapping risk loci for NHL subytpes and several ADs were explored using data from genome-wide association studies. Several common genomic regions and susceptibility loci were identified, suggesting a potential shared genetic background. Two independent MHC regions showed the main overlap, with several alleles in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region exhibiting an opposite risk effect for follicular lymphoma and type I diabetes. These results support continued investigation to further elucidate the relationship between lymphoma and autoimmune diseases.},

The immune system also helps the host eliminate toxic or allergenic substances that enter through mucosal surfaces. Central to the immune system's ability to mobilize a response to an invading pathogen, toxin, or allergen is its ability to distinguish self from nonself. The host uses both innate and adaptive mechanisms to detect and eliminate pathogenic microbes, and both of these mechanisms include self-nonself discrimination. This overview identifies key mechanisms used by the immune system to respond to invading microbes and other exogenous threats and identifies settings in which disturbed immune function exacerbates tissue injury.},

A recent study found that four rare SNPs in the IFIH1 (interferon induced with helicase C domain 1) were significantly associated with T1D. To establish if these SNPs were also involved in MS susceptibility, we chose to examine the non-synonymous SNP rs35667974/Ile923Val which displayed the strongest effect in T1D and was also shown to lead to a loss of IFIH1 function in an in vitro study. We have performed the first association study to test if this rare variant is involved in MS susceptibility in a very large sample consisting of 3037 MS patients and 10,657 healthy controls recruited from Italy and the UK. This study has 99% power to demonstrate an association at the 5% level with this rare variant. Our analysis shows that the nsSNP rs35667974/Ile923Val does not have a role in susceptibility to MS.},

Abundant epidemiological data support a strong genetic basis for both T1D and AITD. Furthermore, both diseases commonly occur in the same individuals and in the same families. Indeed, studies suggest that the etiology of T1D and AITD may involve common genetic factors. Two immune regulatory genes, HLA and CTLA-4 contribute to the susceptibility to both diseases. Additionally, two tissue-specific genes, the insulin VNTR in T1D and Thyroglobulin in AITD play a major role in their pathogenesis. Therefore, it is likely that both immune regulatory and target tissue genes contribute to these and other autoimmune diseases.},

Animals were treated with dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, beginning on the day of infection. Administering dexamethasone on five consecutive days completely blocked the disease. Strikingly, a single dose of dexamethasone was sufficient to prevent islet destruction. Dexamethasone downmodulated inflammation and restored normal ratios between CD8+ and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells in the spleen. Finally, dexamethasone therapy lowered the frequency of splenic anti-virus CD8+ T cells, but did not interfere with the ability of the host to generate anti-KRV antibodies and eliminate the virus from the spleen. Our data demonstrate a strong association between early virus-induced proinflammatory responses and islet destruction and raise the possibility that targeting innate immune pathways in the early stages of diabetes may be a useful strategy for disease prevention.},

With 3-dimensional principal component analysis (3D-PCA) to display phenotypic diversity, we observed a relatively uniform pattern of variation in all subjects tested, highlighting the interrelatedness of previously described subsets and the continuous nature of CD8(+) T cell differentiation. These data also showed much greater complexity in the CD8(+) T cell compartment than previously appreciated, including a nearly combinatorial pattern of cytokine expression, with distinct niches occupied by virus-specific cells. This large degree of functional diversity even between cells with the same specificity gives CD8(+) T cells a remarkable degree of flexibility in responding to pathogens.},

Using a radioimmunoassay, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) were detected in saliva from mice. Unlike epidermal growth factor (EGF), there was no sexual dimorphism in the concentrations of the insulin growth factor family. Immunohistochemical localization of IGF-I and IGF-II was confined to the duct cells of both the parotid and the submandibular glands. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of total RNA from parotid and submandibular glands confirmed the presence of all three hormone/growth factor mRNAs in both glands. The levels of insulin and IGF-I were higher in saliva from an animal model for autoimmune type 1 diabetes, the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, than in a second inbred strain, BALB/c. In contrast, the IGF-II levels were decreased relative to the BALB/c strain. With the onset of diabetes in NOD mice, insulin levels declined, while IGF-I and IGF-II levels showed trends toward lower levels of these growth factors when compared with non-diabetic animals. These changes were reflected in the concentrations from parotid and submandibular gland cell lysates.},

abstract = {Abstract Type 1 diabetes (T1D) in children and particularly in teenagers and adults is strongly associated with autoreactivity to the Mr 65,000 isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65). Autoantibodies to GAD65 are common at the time of clinical diagnosis and may be present for years prior to the onset of hyperglycemia. GAD65 autoantibodies predict conversion to insulin dependence when present in patients classified with type 2 diabetes nowadays more often referred to as patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in the adult (LADA) or type 1,5 diabetes. Analyses of T cells with HLA DRB1*0401-tetramers with GAD65-specific peptides as well as of anti-idiotypic GAD65 autoantibodies suggest that GAD65 autoreactivity is common. The immunological balance is disturbed and the appearance of GAD65 autoantibodies represents markers of autoreactive loss of pancreatic beta cells. Extensive experimental animal research, in particular of the Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, showed that GAD65 therapies reduce insulitis and prevent spontaneous diabetes. Recombinant human GAD65 produced by current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) and formulated with alum was found to be safe in Phase I and II placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trials. The approach to modulate GAD65 autoreactivity with subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) showed promise as alum-formulated GAD65 induced a dose-dependent reduction in the disappearance rate of endogenous residual C-peptide production. Additional controlled clinical trials are needed to uncover the mechanisms by which subcutaneous injections of recombinant human GAD65 may alter GAD65 autoreactivity.},

The generation of humanized animal models of human diseases will be useful to study the interplay between genetic and non-genetic factors in disease development and may form a basis for the development of new drugs that act more specifically than the ones currently in use. Transgenic mice have been generated that express various human proteins---candidate autoantigens, disease-associated MHC class II molecules, TCRs and/or CD4 --- in order to study diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and diabetes.},

abstract = {Replacement of the insulin-producing pancreatic islet $\beta$ cells represents the ultimate treatment for type 1 diabetes. Recent advances in islet transplantation underscore the urgent need for developing alternatives to human tissue donors, which are scarce. Two possible approaches are the expansion of differentiated $\beta$ cells by reversible immortalization and the generation of insulin-producing cells from embryonic or adult stem cells. It is possible that new insights into endocrine pancreas development will ultimately lead to manipulation of progenitor-cell fate towards the $\beta$-cell phenotype of insulin production, storage and regulated secretion. Both allogeneic and autologous surrogate $\beta$ cells are likely to require protection from recurring autoimmunity. This protection might take the form of tolerization, cell encapsulation, or cell engineering with immunoprotective genes. If successful, these approaches could lead to widespread cell replacement therapy for type 1 diabetes.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) are the most common autoimmune endocrine disorders. The similar pathogenesis of T1D and AITD and their tendency to occur together suggest that their etiology may involve common genetic factors. We hypothesized that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus may contribute in part to the joint susceptibility to T1D and AITD. We therefore analyzed a data set of 40 multiplex families in which T1D and AITD clustered (``T1D-AITD families'') for linkage and association with the HLA class II locus. We found evidence for linkage of the HLA region to T1D (maximum logarithm of odds score [MLS] = 7.3), to Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) (MLS = 1.5), and to both (MLS = 3.8). Transmission disequilibrium test analysis revealed significant association of both T1D and AITD with HLA-DR3; however, only T1D was associated with HLA-DR4. We concluded that the finding of evidence for linkage of HLA with HT is in contrast to the strong evidence against linkage found in previous studies of AITD-only families; therefore, it is possible that the AITD phenotype seen in T1D families has a different genetic etiology than the AITD phenotype in AITD-only families; that HLA-DR3 was the major HLA allele contributing to the joint genetic susceptibility to T1D and AITD, whereas other alleles (e.g., DR4) are phenotype specific; and that because the logarithm of odds score for T1D + HT was lower than for T1D alone, additional non-HLA loci must contribute to the shared genetic susceptibility to T1D and AITD.},

Much of the data on this subject points to two possibilities, viruses and wheat gluten. Viruses appear to be involved as an etiological agent in some cases of type 1 diabetes, particularly in fulminant type 1 diabetes. Further analysis of the data suggests that viruses are not the sole trigger of type 1 diabetes in humans, and that wheat gluten may play a role in initiating the disease. Viruses may be the key environmental trigger in some cases of type 1 diabetes, and wheat gluten in others. Conceivably, some cases of type 1 diabetes might be caused by viruses and wheat gluten acting together as disease triggers.},

Methods A systematic review of the literature searching for all HLA-Class II alleles and susceptibility for T1D case--control studies performed in LA was made up to October 2009. Effect summary ORs and 95% CI were obtained by means of the random effect model. A prediction model that identifies peptides binding to HLA-DR alleles that were significantly associated with T1D throughout the meta-analysis was done. Results 21 studies were included (1138 cases and 1920 controls). DRB1*0301 (OR: 9.65; 95% CI: 5.69--16.36; p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.0001), DRB1*1201 (OR: 4.84; 95% CI: 1.97--11.91; p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.001), DQB1*0302 (OR: 4.58; 95% CI: 3.36--6.26; p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.0001), DQA1*0301(OR: 3.02; 95% CI: 1.37--6.65; p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.0059) and DQB1*0602 (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.11--0.33; p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.0001), DRB1*14 (OR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.06--0.55; p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.0024), and DQB1*0501 (OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.26--0.83; p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.0097) were the most significant alleles associated with T1D. DRB1*0301-DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 (OR: 13.50; 95% CI: 3.85--47.28; p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.0001) and DRB1*1301-DQB1*0603 (OR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.1--0.65; p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.004) were the most significant risk and protective haplotypes associated, respectively. There were peptides binding to significantly HLA-DRB1 alleles and haplotypes found through the meta-analysis from islet cell protein tyrosine phosphatase and glutamic acid decarboxylase. Conclusions These results strengthen the effect of HLA-Class II on T1D in LA similar to Caucasians regardless of the latitudinal gradient and admixture. The shared chemical characteristics in critical pockets could explain the predisposition to present a ``diabetogenic peptide'' to T cells in this population.},

abstract = {The currently available data identified IDDM1 and IDDM2 as 2 susceptibility loci for type 1 diabetes (T1D). The major histocompatibility complex (MHC)/HLA region referred to as IDDM1 contains several 100 genes known to have a great influence on T1D risk. Within IDDM2, a minisatellite variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) locus in the insulin gene (INS) promoter region is likely to represent the etiologic polymorphism. The aim of the present work was to study the association between genotypes and susceptibility to T1D among Egyptian diabetic children and their family members. Twenty-five nuclear Egyptian families with 27 children having T1D, aged 3--14{\&}{\#}xa0;years, their non-diabetic 44 sibs, aged 3--15{\&}{\#}xa0;years and their parents were included in our study. All studied children were subjected to: detailed history and family pedigree. Thorough clinical examination and anthropometric measurements. Laboratory work up of diabetes including random blood sugar (RBS) and HbA1C. Molecular genetics of INS was studied in four steps; nucleic acid purification, amplification, sequencing and haplotyping using flanking single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as surrogate markers for minisatellite alleles identification. Analysis of variant repeat distribution among Egyptian families combined with flanking haplotypes revealed that all our diabetic children had class I alleles of INS; 9 had class IC+, 9 had class ID+ and 9 had class ID−, while all non-diabetic family members had class III alleles of INS. Therefore the three class I alleles were considered to be equally predisposing to T1D, while class III alleles are dominantly protective. There was significant positive correlations between body mass index (BMI) and both HbA1C and AST liver enzyme among diabetic children with class IC+ but not other alleles; indicating that they need close monitoring of their diabetic control and liver functions beside following specific dietary regimens. It can be concluded that all class I alleles (IC+, ID+ and ID−) are equally important susceptibility factors for T1D among Egyptian children, while class III alleles (IIIA and IIIB) are dominantly protective. It is concluded also that our diabetic children with class IC+ are an especially endangered subgroup of diabetics. Genotyping for INS-VNTR alleles is recommended for diabetic children as an important step of diagnostic and follow up regimens and for their non-diabetic family members for family counseling and early identification of potential diabetics. Further studies of INS-VNTR alleles and HLA haplotypes all over Egypt are recommended to define the Egyptian susceptibility loci for T1D and their relations to the clinical and laboratory findings as an important national programs.},

It is now well established that the T cell-repertoire of healthy individuals harbors self-reactive lymphocytes with a potential to cause autoimmune disease and these lymphocytes are under dominant control by a unique subpopulation of CD4+ T cells now called regulatory T cells. Efforts to delineate these Treg cells naturally present in normal individuals have revealed that they are enriched in the CD25+CD4+ population. The identification of the CD25 molecule as a useful marker for naturally arising CD4+ regulatory T cells has made it possible to investigate many key aspects of their immunobiology, including their antigen specificities and the cellular/molecular pathways involved in their development and their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, reduction or dysfunction of the CD25+CD4+ regulatory T cell population can be responsible for certain autoimmune diseases in humans.},

abstract = {Chromosomal DNA is characterized by variation between individuals at the level of entire chromosomes (e.g. aneuploidy in which the chromosome copy number is altered), segmental changes (including insertions, deletions, inversions, and translocations), and changes to small genomic regions (including single nucleotide polymorphisms). A variety of alterations that occur in chromosomal DNA, many of which can be detected using high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, are linked to normal variation as well as disease and therefore of particular interest. These include changes in copy number (deletions and duplications) and genotype (e.g. the occurrence of regions of homozygosity). Hidden Markov models (HMM) are particularly useful for detecting such alterations, modeling the spatial dependence between neighboring SNPs. Here, we improve previous approaches that utilize HMM frameworks for inference in high throughput SNP arrays by integrating copy number, genotype calls, and the corresponding measures of uncertainty when available. Using simulated and experimental data, we in particular demonstrate how confidence scores control smoothing in a probabilistic framework. Software for fitting HMMs to SNP array data is available in the R package vanillaICE.},

abstract = {Summary This paper presents a series of 10 hypotheses on the etiology of type 1 diabetes. We begin with the hypothesis that wheat gluten is one of the elusive environmental triggers in type 1 diabetes. Habitual consumption of wheat gluten increases the intestinal synthesis of dipeptidyl peptidase IV. This enzyme helps to shape the repertoire of peptides released into the small intestine following the ingestion of wheat gluten by catalyzing the release of X-Pro dipeptides from the N-terminus of the proline-rich glutenins and gliadins in wheat gluten. The release of gluten-derived peptides causes the tight junctions of the small intestine to open through a zonulin-dependent mechanism, which allows these peptides to enter the lamina propria where they get presented as antigens by HLA-DQ, -DR and CD1d molecules. Binding of one or more gluten peptides by CD1d leads to abrogation of oral tolerance, and a marked increase in peripheral immune responses to wheat proteins. Furthermore, it is our contention, that in response to $\beta$ cell apoptosis during normal remodeling of the pancreas and CCL19/CCL21 expression within the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs), gluten-loaded dendritic cells migrate from the small intestine to the PLNs. These dendritic cells present gluten-derived antigens on the surface of the PLNs, which leads to migration of CD4−CD8− $\gamma$$\delta$ and CD4−CD8+ $\alpha$$\beta$ T cells to the pancreas where they mediate Fas and perforin dependent cytotoxicity. We also hypothesize that at least one of the type 1 diabetes associated HLA-DR molecules that bind and present wheat-derived peptide(s) also bind and present an islet cell antigen(s), activating plasma cell synthesis of islet cell autoantibodies and irrevocable, complement-dependent destruction of islet cells. Our final two hypotheses state that type 1 diabetes morbidity is reduced in those areas of globe where genetically susceptible individuals get adequate amounts of vitamin D, in the diet and/or through exposure to sunlight, and in areas where people are exposed to bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections in early childhood.},

abstract = {Clinical symptoms of Th1 mediated autoimmune diseases regress in many patients during pregnancy. A prominent feature of pregnancy is the presence of human chorionic gonadotrophin hormone (hCG) in blood and urine. In this report we tested the effect of clinical grade hCG (c-hCG) on the development of diabetes, a Th1 mediated autoimmune disease, in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. We show that treatment of NOD mice with c-hCG before the onset of clinical symptoms lowered the increased blood glucose levels, reversed the established inflammatory infiltrate of pancreatic tissue, and profoundly inhibited the development of diabetes for prolonged time. c-hCG also induced profound inhibition of the functional activity (i.e. production of IFN-$\gamma$) of Th1 cells. Transfer of spleen cells from c-hCG-treated NOD mice into immunocompromised NOD.SCID mice inhibited the development of diabetes in these otherwise nontreated mice. This shows that the treatment of the donor NOD mice induced persistent changes in the immune system. The antidiabetic activity of c-hCG was not caused by heterodimeric hCG or its subunits. Instead, this antidiabetic activity resided in a fraction of c-hCG preparation that contains a 400--2000 Dalton natural (immuno) modulatory pregnancy factor (NMPF).},

abstract = {Diabetes susceptibility in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice may entail faulty activation of immunoregulatory cells resulting from cytokine deficiencies. Depletion of T cells prevents disease onset in these mice. Since we had previously shown that IL-2 treatment in vivo restored the ability of NODLt mice to produce self-restricted suppressor T cells (Ts) in a syngeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (SMLR), we investigated the possibility that diabetes could be circumvented by treatment with immunostimulatory agents that increase cytokine production. By 20 weeks of age, 75% of vehicle-treated NODLt female controls had become glycosuric, while glycosuria developed in only 17% of NODLt females injected with human recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2, 250 U twice weekly) beginning at 6 weeks of age. Treatment of mice with Poly [I:C] alone [50 $\mu$g twice weekly, an inducer of Interferon (IFN)$\alpha$$\beta$] or in conjunction with rIL-2 was even more effective, completely preventing glycosuria for 20 weeks. However, therapeutic effects required continuous administration of the immunostimulants since pancreatic insulin content declined and severity of insulitis increased following cessation of treatment. IL-2 treatment increased transcription of interleukin-1 (IL-1) mRNA in peritoneal macrophages and increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated IL-1 secretion in comparison to controls. In the presence of stimulators from IL-2-treated mice, T lymphocytes isolated from both controls and IL-2-treated NODLt mice proliferated in a SMLR and acquired Ts function. Peritoneal macrophages from Poly [I:C]-treated mice exhibited increased IFN$\alpha$ gene transcription and LPS-stimulated IL-1 secretion. T cells isolated from Poly [I:C]-treated mice were capable of suppressing NOD-Lt T cell responses to alloantigens in a mixed lymphocyte culture without prior activation in a SMLR. Thus, Poly [I:C] treatment may recruit a different population of regulatory cells than those elicited by treatment with IL-2. However, the mechanisms by which autoreactive T-cell clones may be regulated by these two treatments in NODLt mice may be synergistic. These results indicate that in addition to T-cell depletion protocols, diabetes in NOD mice can be prevented by treatment with immunostimulatory agents.},

Purified porcine islets were immediately encapsulated into microbeads of agarose polystyrene sulfonic acid (Ag-PSSa). They remained morphologically intact by dithizone staining after 7 days in culture. Insulin secretion from encapsulated islets was determined in response to glucose challenge during perifusion. When encapsulated islets were exposed to 200 mg/dL glucose, within 5 minutes, insulin release became 5-fold greater than that at 80 mg/dL. However, a second phase insulin secretion appeared in response to 250 mg/dL glucose challenge. In xenotransplantation, microencapsulated porcine islets (1000 to 1800 MC islets) were transplanted into the peritoneal cavity of diabetic NOD mice (n = 4) without immunosuppression. The survival times after the onset of diabetes were observed after both MC islets transplanted NOD mice and nontransplanted NOD mice (n = 4). MC islets transplant recipients had significantly (P {\&}lt; .05) longer survival (47.5 $\pm$ 18.6; mean $\pm$ SD) than nontransplanted NOD mice (21.0 $\pm$ 9.31), although random blood glucose levels were not normalized.},

Peptide fractions were obtained by treatment of affinity-purified HLA-DR and -DQ molecules with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and were subjected to reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The RP-HPLC profiles of peptides derived from DR molecules revealed three peaks that specifically appeared after pulsing, but no such peaks were obtained from DQ molecules. From one of these three peaks, a peptide that consisted of 14 amino acids (AKSXNHTXXNQXRK, where X represents the undetermined amino acids) was identified. This peptide was derived from heparin/heparan sulfate-interacting protein (HIP). Immunostaining of pancreatic sections using antiserum for HIP peptide revealed exclusive staining of the islets. Thus, HIP was identified as an islet protein naturally processed and presented by HLA-DR4 molecules.},

We have investigated whether a heparin analogue (ITF-5005) can alter lymphocytic infiltration of the endocrine pancreas (insulitis) and/or diabetes incidence in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. Sixty-four NOD mice were divided at weaning and injected subcutaneously five times per week with either 18, 36 or 72 $\mu$g/kg body weight of ITF-5005 or saline as a control. At 12 weeks of age, the animals were culled and their pancreata sectioned, stained and assessed `blind' for insulitis and insulin containing cells. Insulitis was similar in all groups as was the proportion of insulin-containing cells. To determine the effect on diabetes incidence, two groups of mice were injected with either saline or 140 $\mu$g/kg body weight of ITF-5005 from weaning until 30 weeks of age. No difference was found in overall diabetes incidence; however, disease onset was significantly accelerated in the treated group. We conclude that ITF-5005, at the doses employed, has no effect on insulitis or the proportion of insulin-containing cells found in the pancreas, but that it can accelerate the course of diabetes in the NOD mouse.},

Innovative randomized trials, mostly placebo controlled, were conducted based on data from animal studies. Results were variable but major proof of concept emerged from these trials. That is exactly the case with CD3-specific monoclonal antibodies whose usage in new onset diabetic patients provided very promising results in terms of preservation of pancreatic $\beta$-cell mass and function. CD3 antibody therapy showed that it was possible to obtain a long-term therapeutic effect following short course administration of a biological agent promoting immune regulation. The next sensible step to go for is to improve the usage of CD3 antibody in terms of safety and effectiveness over the long term. The proposal would be to combine CD3 antibodies with strategies targeting the different actors of the immune and inflammatory responses ($\beta$ cells, antigen presenting cells and T lymphocytes).

Recent findings suggest that the events controlling T1D development are not only immunological, but also neuronal in nature. In the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D, a mutant sensory neuron channel, TRPV1, initiates chronic, progressive $\beta$-cell stress, inducing islet cell inflammation. This novel mechanism of organ-specific damage requires a permissive, autoimmune-prone host, but ascribes tissue specificity to the local secretory dysfunction of sensory afferent neurons. In NOD mice, normalizing this neuronal function by administration of the neurotransmitter substance P clears islet cell inflammation, reduces insulin resistance and restores normoglycemia. Here, we discuss this neuro--immuno--endocrine model, its implications and the involvement of sensory neurons in other autoimmune disorders. These developments might provide novel neuronal-based therapeutic interventions, particularly in diabetes.},

In this study, we investigated the role of STAT4 in autoimmune diabetes. We crossbred Stat4 deficient (Stat4−/−) mice with nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice to generate the Stat4−/−NOD model. In Stat4−/−NOD mice, serum levels of both IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-2 were significantly reduced as compared to the controls. Insulin secretion in pancreatic islets was preserved in Stat4−/−NOD mice. Significantly, disruption of Stat4 activation completely prevented the development of spontaneous diabetes in NOD mice.

Many independent experiments indicate that RNA polymerase II is frequently initiated but paused in the sense direction downstream from the promoter. Similarly a second peak of transcriptionally-engaged polymerase is paused in the anti-sense direction upstream of the promoter. Chromatin modifications that are associated with active promoters reside in nucleosomes immediately flanking this pair of paused polymerases. The nucleosome-free region associated with most promoters could in part be defined by this divergent transcription. The potential implications of divergent transcription on gene regulation and possible mechanisms that give rise to this phenomenon are discussed.},

Several CD/TgAA+ relatives also had islet cell antigen or adrenal autoimmunity. Affected relatives are more closely related than expected from the pedigree relationships of all family members and were more often the offspring of consanguineous marriages. Individuals with CD or TgAA+ were enriched for DRB1*0301-DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201, a haplotype previously reported as high risk for CD. There was also an increased frequency of DQB1*0201/DQB1*0201 homozygotes among affected relatives. We found no evidence that DRB1*0701-DQA1*0201-DQB1*0201/DRB1*11-DQA1*0501-DQB1*0301 is a high-risk genotype, consistent with other studies of Arab communities.

abstract = {1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), the active form of vitamin D, is known to regulate calcium and phosphorus metabolism, thus being a key-player in bone-formation. However 1,25(OH)2D3 also has a physiological role beyond its well-known role in skeletal homeostasis. Here, we describe 1,25(OH)2D3 as an immunomodulator targeting various immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), as well as T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, hence modulating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Besides being targets, immune cells express vitamin D-activating enzymes, allowing local conversion of inactive vitamin D into 1,25(OH)2D3 within the immune system. Taken together, these data indicate that 1,25(OH)2D3 plays a role in maintenance of immune homeostasis. Several epidemiological studies have linked inadequate vitamin D levels to a higher susceptibility of immune-mediated disorders, including chronic infections and autoimmune diseases. This review will discuss the complex immune-regulatory effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on immune cells as well as its role in infectious and autoimmune diseases, more in particular in tuberculosis and type 1 diabetes (T1D).},

The aim of this study was to investigate the association pattern of the extended MHC region with T1D susceptibility to identify effects independent of well established DR/DQ genes. A total of 394 Europid families with T1D were genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the olfactory receptor family 14, subfamily J, member 1 (OR14J1) gene, rs9257691, in the MHC telomeric region. The OR provides ``an internal depiction of our external world'' through the capture of odorant molecules in the main OR system by several large families of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). These receptors transduce and chemosignals into the central nervous system (CNS). This SNP was chosen to identify its association with T1D. Interestingly, OR14J1C allele was significantly associated with T1D that seems to go with DRB1*0401, $\mathrm{X}$2{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;10.9, p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.0003. However, by fixing both genes of DR*0401--DQB1*0302, high risk, the association of T1D with OR14J1C still existed, $\mathrm{X}$2{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;7.4, p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.005. The occurrence of association of the OR14J1C allele with T1D patients with DRB1*401/DQB1*0302 is an independent risk for T1D. As an accumulative report suggests the role of OR in the pathogenesis of diabetic microvascular and other diabetic complications, undoubtedly, this haplotype specific alteration of T1D risk is an independent risk for the disease and can address the promising MHC-linked gene other than DR/DQ. Moreover, there is nothing to hinder for that this might be a signal that identifies the role of OR gene in the pathogenesis of T1D in patients who are prone to diabetic complications.},

Recent reports suggest that AAV vectors based on serotype 1 (AAV-1) transduce murine skeletal muscle much more efficiently than AAV-2, with reported increases in expression ranging from 2 to 1000-fold. To determine whether this increased efficacy of AAV-1 could result in increased therapeutic effects in mice, we constructed rAAV1/GAD500--585 vectors and compared their effects in preventing autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice with those of rAAV2/GAD500--585 after muscle injection. rAAV1/GAD500--585 gene therapy prevented diabetes in NOD mice. However, although much higher level of GAD500--585 expression was found in mice using AAV-1 as gene delivery vector than those using AAV-2, no increased efficiency of AAV-1 vectors were found in their capability to prevent autoimmune diabetes, as higher titers of rAAV1/GAD500--585 virus (3{\&}{\#}xa0;×{\&}{\#}xa0;1011{\&}{\#}xa0;v.g./mouse) were needed to obtain therapeutic effects in NOD mice, a titer not different from that of AAV-2. Protection resulted from rAAV1/GAD500--585 gene therapy were marked by enhanced Th2 immune response and up-regulated CD4+Foxp3+T regulatory cells, which might actively suppress effector T cells in NOD mice. As here we found that the therapeutic effects of AAV1 were not positively correlated to it's transduction efficiency, our data suggested that the safety and other factors besides efficiency should be considered when use different AAV serotype to treat autoimmune disease.},

abstract = {Genome-wide pervasive transcription has been reported in many eukaryotic organisms, revealing a highly interleaved transcriptome organization that involves hundreds of previously unknown non-coding RNAs. These recently identified transcripts either exist stably in cells (stable unannotated transcripts, SUTs) or are rapidly degraded by the RNA surveillance pathway (cryptic unstable transcripts, CUTs). One characteristic of pervasive transcription is the extensive overlap of SUTs and CUTs with previously annotated features, which prompts questions regarding how these transcripts are generated, and whether they exert function. Single-gene studies have shown that transcription of SUTs and CUTs can be functional, through mechanisms involving the generated RNAs or their generation itself. So far, a complete transcriptome architecture including SUTs and CUTs has not been described in any organism. Knowledge about the position and genome-wide arrangement of these transcripts will be instrumental in understanding their function. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of these transcripts in the context of multiple conditions, a mutant of the exosome machinery and different strain backgrounds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that both SUTs and CUTs display distinct patterns of distribution at specific locations. Most of the newly identified transcripts initiate from nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) associated with the promoters of other transcripts (mostly protein-coding genes), or from NFRs at the 3' ends of protein-coding genes. Likewise, about half of all coding transcripts initiate from NFRs associated with promoters of other transcripts. These data change our view of how a genome is transcribed, indicating that bidirectionality is an inherent feature of promoters. Such an arrangement of divergent and overlapping transcripts may provide a mechanism for local spreading of regulatory signals-that is, coupling the transcriptional regulation of neighbouring genes by means of transcriptional interference or histone modification.},

Dissection of these pathways requires strategies for precisely following transcripts as they are being produced. Here we present an approach (native elongating transcript sequencing, NET-seq), based on deep sequencing of 3' ends of nascent transcripts associated with RNA polymerase, to monitor transcription at nucleotide resolution. Application of NET-seq in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that although promoters are generally capable of divergent transcription, the Rpd3S deacetylation complex enforces strong directionality to most promoters by suppressing antisense transcript initiation. Our studies also reveal pervasive polymerase pausing and backtracking throughout the body of transcripts. Average pause density shows prominent peaks at each of the first four nucleosomes, with the peak location occurring in good agreement with in vitro biophysical measurements. Thus, nucleosome-induced pausing represents a major barrier to transcriptional elongation in vivo.},

abstract = {There is growing recognition that mammalian cells produce many thousands of large intergenic transcripts. However, the functional significance of these transcripts has been particularly controversial. Although there are some well-characterized examples, most (>95%) show little evidence of evolutionary conservation and have been suggested to represent transcriptional noise. Here we report a new approach to identifying large non-coding RNAs using chromatin-state maps to discover discrete transcriptional units intervening known protein-coding loci. Our approach identified approximately 1,600 large multi-exonic RNAs across four mouse cell types. In sharp contrast to previous collections, these large intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) show strong purifying selection in their genomic loci, exonic sequences and promoter regions, with greater than 95% showing clear evolutionary conservation. We also developed a functional genomics approach that assigns putative functions to each lincRNA, demonstrating a diverse range of roles for lincRNAs in processes from embryonic stem cell pluripotency to cell proliferation. We obtained independent functional validation for the predictions for over 100 lincRNAs, using cell-based assays. In particular, we demonstrate that specific lincRNAs are transcriptionally regulated by key transcription factors in these processes such as p53, NFkappaB, Sox2, Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) and Nanog. Together, these results define a unique collection of functional lincRNAs that are highly conserved and implicated in diverse biological processes.},

This revealed a class of short, polyadenylated and highly unstable RNAs. These promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs) are produced approximately 0.5 to 2.5 kilobases upstream of active transcription start sites. PROMPT transcription occurs in both sense and antisense directions with respect to the downstream gene. In addition, it requires the presence of the gene promoter and is positively correlated with gene activity.

Although these shared many characteristics with mammalian lincRNAs, only 29 had detectable sequence similarity with putative mammalian orthologs, typically restricted to a single short region of high conservation. Other lincRNAs had conserved genomic locations without detectable sequence conservation. Antisense reagents targeting conserved regions of two zebrafish lincRNAs caused developmental defects. Reagents targeting splice sites caused the same defects and were rescued by adding either the mature lincRNA or its human or mouse ortholog. Our study provides a roadmap for identification and analysis of lincRNAs in model organisms and shows that lincRNAs play crucial biological roles during embryonic development with functionality conserved despite limited sequence conservation.},

In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of sense-antisense expression in response to genetic and environmental changes in yeast. We find that antisense expression is associated with genes of larger expression variability. This is characterized by more 'switching off' at low levels of expression for genes with antisense compared to genes without, yet similar expression at maximal induction. By disrupting antisense transcription, we demonstrate that antisense expression confers an on-off switch on gene regulation for the SUR7 gene. Consistent with this, genes that must respond in a switch-like manner, such as stress-response and environment-specific genes, are enriched for antisense expression. In addition, our data provide evidence that antisense expression initiated from bidirectional promoters enables the spreading of regulatory signals from one locus to neighbouring genes. These results indicate a general regulatory effect of antisense expression on sense genes and emphasize the importance of antisense-initiating regions downstream of genes in models of gene regulation.},

abstract = {Transcriptome profiling studies suggest that a large fraction of the genome is transcribed and many transcripts function independent of their protein coding potential. The relevance of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in normal physiological processes and in tumorigenesis is increasingly recognized. Here, we describe consistent and significant differences in the distribution of sense and antisense transcripts between normal and neoplastic breast tissues. Many of the differentially expressed antisense transcripts likely represent long ncRNAs. A subset of genes that mainly generate antisense transcripts in normal but not cancer cells is involved in essential metabolic processes. These findings suggest fundamental differences in global RNA regulation between normal and cancer cells that might play a role in tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {We recently showed that the mammalian genome encodes >1,000 large intergenic noncoding (linc)RNAs that are clearly conserved across mammals and, thus, functional. Gene expression patterns have implicated these lincRNAs in diverse biological processes, including cell-cycle regulation, immune surveillance, and embryonic stem cell pluripotency. However, the mechanism by which these lincRNAs function is unknown. Here, we expand the catalog of human lincRNAs to approximately 3,300 by analyzing chromatin-state maps of various human cell types. Inspired by the observation that the well-characterized lincRNA HOTAIR binds the polycomb repressive complex (PRC)2, we tested whether many lincRNAs are physically associated with PRC2. Remarkably, we observe that approximately 20% of lincRNAs expressed in various cell types are bound by PRC2, and that additional lincRNAs are bound by other chromatin-modifying complexes. Also, we show that siRNA-mediated depletion of certain lincRNAs associated with PRC2 leads to changes in gene expression, and that the up-regulated genes are enriched for those normally silenced by PRC2. We propose a model in which some lincRNAs guide chromatin-modifying complexes to specific genomic loci to regulate gene expression.},

abstract = {In human pregnancies mothers and their embryo/fetuses are invariably genetically different. Thus, attenuation of the adaptive maternal immune response, which is programmed to reject `foreign' entities, is required for pregnancy to be initiated and maintained. Unexpectedly, given the propensity of the immune system to dispose of non-self entities, at least 50% of expected human pregnancies reliably go forward. This indicates that to a large extent, effective systems of tolerance have evolved. Although overlapping and redundant mechanisms of tolerance have been identified, production of HLA-G by trophoblast cells derived from the external trophectoderm layer of the blastocyst appears to be of major importance. At this point in time, no pregnancies in which all of the proteins derived from the HLA-G gene are absent have as yet been reported. Many studies have shown that both membrane-bound and soluble isoforms of the proteins derived from this HLA class Ib gene are produced by placental trophoblast cells, with consequences that include but are not restricted to immune suppression at the maternal--fetal interface. Here we report new studies that are leading to a better understanding of the HLA-G proteins, their unique structures, unusual modes of regulation, diverse functions, and potential for use in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures related to suboptimal fertility in women.},

abstract = {Enterovirus (EV) infections have been associated with the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D). They may cause $\beta$-cell destruction either by cytolytic infection of the cells or indirectly by triggering the autoimmune response. Evidence for EV involvement have been presented in several studies, EV-IgM antibodies have been reported in T1D patients, EV-RNA has been found in the blood from T1D patients at onset, and EV have been isolated from newly diagnosed T1D. Our aim was to study infections with EV isolates from newly diagnosed T1D patients in human pancreatic islets in vitro. Two of them (T1 and T2) originated from a mother and her son diagnosed with T1D on the same day, the other two (A and E) were isolated from a pair of twins at the time of diagnosis of T1D in one of them. Isolated human pancreatic islets were infected and viral replication, viability and degree of cytolysis as well as insulin release in response to high glucose were measured. All four EV isolates replicated in the islet cells and virus particles and virus-induced vesicles were seen in the cytoplasm of the $\beta$-cells. The isolates varied in their ability to induce cytolysis and to cause destruction of the islets and infection with two of the isolates (T1 and A) caused more pronounced destruction of the islets. Infection with the isolate from the healthy twin boy (E) was the least cytolytic. The ability to secrete insulin in response to high glucose was reduced in all infected islets as early as 3 days post infection, before any difference in viability was observed. To conclude, strains of EV isolated from T1D patients at clinical presentation of T1D revealed $\beta$-cell tropism, and clearly affected the function of the $\beta$-cell. In addition, the infection caused a clear increase in the number of dead cells.},

Using the highly multiplexed Molecular Inversion Probe technology as an example, we describe a methodology for identifying the optimal trade-off. The methodology comprises: a robust clustering algorithm and assessment of a large number of data filter sets. The clustering algorithm allows for automatic genotype determination. Many different sets of filters are then applied to the clustered data, and performance metrics resulting from each filter set are calculated. These performance metrics relate to the power of a study and provide a framework to choose the most suitable filter set to the particular study.},

When the defect in cellular immunity was studied by exposing mononuclear cells (MNC) from uremic patients and controls to tetanus toxoid, diptheria toxoid, or Candida albicans antigen in vitro, the uremic cells were far less responsive. Monocytes and T cells, which are both involved in the proliferative response to soluble antigens, were isolated from MNC of uremic patients and HLA class II matched controls and incubated with tetanus toxoid. Tetanus toxoid-pulsed uremic monocytes were unable to stimulate the proliferation of HLA identical control T lymphocytes. Lymphocytes from uremic patients, however, were stimulated by tetanus toxoid-pulsed control monocytes. Therefore, the ability of monocytes to function as accessory cells is severely affected by uremia. The uremic monocytes were FcR +, produced IL-1$\beta$, and expressed levels of HLA class II antigens comparable to controls. Although the biochemical defect in uremic monocytes remains unknown, the abnormality could explain many of the immunological changes of uremia.},

Here, we study the role of STAT3 in Treg cell induction. We found that GAD--IgG-transduced splenocytes induce a CD4+Foxp3+Treg cell increase in NOD mice. In parallel with the Treg cell increase, an IL-6-STAT3 signal pathway is activated. When STAT3 activation is blocked, GAD-specific tolerance disappears, the percentage of Treg cells decreases and IL-10 secretion is reduced in the splenocytes of NOD mice recipients of GAD--IgG-transduced splenocytes. Our findings indicate that transcription factor STAT3 plays an important role in immune tolerance.},

Since human islets are scarce, we evaluated the efficacy of a microencapsulated insulin-secreting conditionally transformed allogeneic $\beta$-cell line ($\beta$TC-tet) in non-obese diabetic mice treated with tetracycline to inhibit cell growth. Relatively low serum levels of tetracycline controlled proliferation of $\beta$TC-tet cells without inhibiting effective control of hyperglycemia in recipients. There was no significant host cellular reaction to the allografts or host cell adherence to microcapsules, and host cytokine levels were similar to those of sham-operated controls. We conclude that encapsulated allogeneic $\beta$-cell lines may be clinically relevant, because they effectively restore euglycemia and do not elicit a strong cellular immune response following transplantation. To our knowledge, this is the first extensive characterization of the kinetics of host cellular and cytokine responses to an encapsulated islet cell line in an animal model of type 1 diabetes.},

abstract = {Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a dominant role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes, commonly denoted Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). These CTLs (notably CD 8 + T cells) recognize and kill insulin-secreting pancreatic $\beta$ cells, reducing their number by ∼ 90 % . The resulting reduction of insulin secretion causes the defective regulation of glucose metabolism, leading to the characteristic symptoms of diabetes. Recognition of $\beta$ cells as targets by CTLs depends on the interactions between MHC-peptide complexes on the surface of $\beta$ cells and receptors (TCRs) on T cells. Those CTLs with high affinity TCRs (also called high avidity T cells) cause most of the harm, while those with low affinity TCRs (also called low avidity T cells) play a more mysterious role. Recent experimental evidence suggests that low avidity T cells accumulate as memory T cells during the disease and may be protective in NOD mice (a strain prone to developing T1D), delaying disease progression. It has been hypothesized that such low avidity T cells afford disease protection either by crowding the islets of Langerhans, where $\beta$ cells reside, or by killing antigen presenting cells (APCs). In this paper, we explore the hypothesized mechanisms for this protective effect in the context of a series of models for (1) the interactions of low and high avidity T cells, (2) the effect of APCs and (3) the feedback from $\beta$ cell killing to autoantigen-induced T cell proliferation. We analyze properties of these models, noting consistency of predictions with observed behaviour. We then use the models to examine the influence of various treatment strategies on the progression of the disease. The model reveals that progressive accumulation of memory low avidity autoreactive T cells during disease progression makes treatments aimed at expanding these protective T cell types more effective close to, or at the onset of clinical disease. It also provides evidence for the hypothesis that low avidity T cells kill APCs (rather than the alternate hypothesis that they crowd the islets).},

Recent studies have demonstrated that the development of Th1 and Th2 responses may be significantly influenced by the costimulatory molecules recognized by responding CD4 T cells, and by other undefined factors in the genetic background. It has also been demonstrated that autoreactive Th2 CD4+ cells can regulate the activity of disease-causing Th1 CD4+ T cells in vivo. Control of autoimmune disease may thus be achieved by procedures that regulate the relative contribution of Th1/Th2 CD4 T cells to an autoimmune response.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is a common autoimmune disease that affects millions of people worldwide and has an incidence that is increasing at a striking rate, especially in young children. It results from the targeted self-destruction of the insulin-secreting $\beta$ cells of the pancreas and requires lifelong insulin treatment. The effects of chronic hyperglycemia -- the result of insulin deficiency -- include secondary endorgan complications. Over the past two decades our increased understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease has led to the development of new immunomodulatory treatments. None have yet received regulatory approval, but this report highlights recent progress in this area.},

abstract = {The immune system requires a homeostatic equilibrium between the mechanisms that assure self-tolerance, those that control the capacity to mount life-long immunity to pathogenic microbes, and those that attenuate effector mechanisms from inducing immune pathology [Sakaguchi S, Yamaguchi T, Nomura T, Ono M: Regulatory T cells and immune tolerance.

In the past decade, an overwhelming body of literature showed that CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are a dominant mechanism regulating the decision fate of these different immunological outcomes. Indeed, CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells develop largely in the thymus but can be induced in the periphery throughout the course of immune responses [Sakaguchi S, Yamaguchi T, Nomura T, Ono M: Regulatory T cells and immune tolerance.

Treg cells have emerged as a central control point in the regulation of autoimmune responses. Despite progress made in various in vitro and in vivo models, much uncertainty exists over their mechanism of action in vivo. Here, we summarize research characterizing the functional dynamics of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells in the control of autoimmunity in rodents and humans.},

This review discusses the requirements for induction of dominant tolerance exerted by Foxp3+ Tregs in autoimmunity with special emphasis on their impact to interfere with T1D.

Genes in the HLA complex are among the strongest predisposing genetic factors. The HLA complex genes primarily involved are most often those encoding the peptide-presenting HLA class I or II molecules. A probable mechanism is preferential presentation by the disease-associated HLA molecules of peptides from autoantigens to T cells. Recent studies have shown, however, that other genes in the HLA complex also contribute. Taken together, available evidence suggests that the HLA complex harbour both disease predisposing genes which are quite specific for some autoimmune diseases (e.g. HLA-B27 for ankylosing spondylitis) and others which may be more common for several diseases. This will be briefly reviewed in the following.},

This cohort consisted of 1966 children with diabetes and 1780 of randomly selected subjects with normal fasting glycemia. Questionnaires were designed for telephone interviews with students' parents or physicians to classify subjects' types of diabetes. The birth history of each participant was obtained from the Taiwan's Birth Registry. After merging the data, there were 835 subjects, including 277 of type 1 diabetes and 533 of normal fasting glycemia available for the present analyses. The odds ratio (95% CI) for type 1 diabetes, after adjusting age, sex, socioeconomic status, family history of diabetes, birth order, breast-feeding, BMI, and gestational diabetes mellitus was 2.24 (1.11--4.50) for children with low birth weight ({\&}lt;5th percentile, i.e., ≤2600{\&}{\#}xa0;g) when compared with the referent group of a birth weight of 3000--3542{\&}{\#}xa0;g (equivalent to the 25--75th percentile).

T‐cell clones are being used to screen peptide libraries and proteomic arrays to identify the autoantigens that drive these clones in vivo and to extend our knowledge of the processes that give rise to these antigens. With the identification of peptide agonists and natural ligands, the development of MHC‐peptide multimers has been possible.

Many of these have subsequently been found in patients with both prediabetes and recent-onset diabetes. New therapeutic approaches have been developed in the NOD model and some of these have been tested in patients with recent-onset T1DM, which is complex and chronic autoimmune disease with a serious clinical impact. It is estimated that approximately 1--1.5 million patients have T1DM in the United States. During that time there has been a rough doubling of the incidence of diabetes in relatively stable population. 15 distinct B cell derived peptides and the corresponding CD4 T cells have been identified among various laboratories. The searches have followed different approaches: testing T cell lines or clones on proteins known to be part of the B cell secretory granules and (or) proteins first identified by autoantibodies. Effects of administration of glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD 65) to patients with recent-onset T1D, and the prospect for trials to prevent T1DM in susceptible human populations are also described in the chapter.},

This study demonstrates that the disruption of the CD28/B7 pathway early in the nonobese diabetic mouse strain, using CD28−/− and CTLA4lg transgenic mice, promoted the development and progression of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes. Functional analyses of T cells isolated from CD28-deficient mice demonstrated that the GAD-specific T cells produced enhanced Th1-type cytokines (IL-2 and IFN$\gamma$) and diminished Th2-type cytokine, IL-4. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in serum levels of anti-GAD antibodies of the IgG1 isotype consistent with a profound suppression of Th2-type responses in these animals. Thus, the early differentiation of naive diabetogenic T cells into the Th2 subset is dependent upon CD28 signaling and extends our understanding of the importance of Th1/Th2 balance in the regulation of this spontaneous autoimmune disease.},

abstract = {Persons expressing the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from a high risk of developing impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. The development of diabetes in CF has been attributed, in the past, to the destruction of pancreatic islets and their resident $\beta$-cells secondary to the destruction of the surrounding tissue by mechanical clogging of the pancreatic exocrine ducts. However, the discovery that autoimmunity to the 60-kDa heat shock protein (hsp60) may cause type I diabetes in NOD mice raises the possibility that hsp60 autoimmunity may be involved in CF diabetes too; could the hyperimmunization to bacterial hsp60 characteristic of CF spread to self-hsp60 and hence to autoimmune diabetes? We now report that rising levels of IgG autoantibodies to hsp60 do indeed precede the appearance of glucose intolerance and diabetes in CF patients. We produced a recombinant human pancreatic hsp60 protein and investigated the IgG antibody response to hsp60 in prediabetic and non-diabetic patients with CF. To detect hsp60 autoantibodies in the presence of high levels of antibodies to bacterial hsp60, we absorbed test sera with the 60-kDa GroEL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and used an immunostaining technique. Using this technique, 32 prediabetic CF patients were evaluated over a five-year period, three years, on the average, before the onset of glucose intolerance. We found that a significant increase in hsp60 autoantibody preceded impaired glucose tolerance (P=0.042, n=17), diabetes (P=0.011, n=15) and glucose intolerance (P=0.005, n=32). As has been observed in NOD mice and in type I diabetic patients, the hsp60 autoantibodies decline at the outbreak of glucose intolerance in the CF patients. The association of CF diabetes with the rise and fall of hsp60 autoimmunity suggests that the pathogenesis of the diabetes may not be merely mechanical, but arise in the wake of bacterial hyperimmunisation.},

abstract = {Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice develop Sj{\"o}gren's-like syndrome (Ss) and a gradual loss of saliva secretory function. Our previous study showed that injections of matched normal spleen cells with Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) reversed salivary gland dysfunction in 14-week-old NOD mice, which had established Ss. The spleen and bone marrow are closely related organs, and both are among the first sites of hematopoiesis during gestation. Noticing a rapidly increasing number of clinical trials using bone marrow (BM) cells treatments for autoimmune diseases, we tested if BM cells can prevent Ss and restore salivary glands' function. We injected CFA and MHC class I-matched normal BM cells in 7-week-old NOD mice, which had not yet developed Ss. We found at week 52 post-treatment that all NOD mice receiving BM cells and CFA had a recovery of salivary flow and were protected from Ss and diabetes. BM cells-treated mice had their salivary function restored quantitatively and qualitatively. Saliva flow was higher (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05) in BM cells-transplanted mice when compared to control mice, which continued to deteriorate over time. Total proteins, epidermal growth factor, amylase, and electrolytes concentrations in saliva of BM cells-treated mice were not significantly changed at week 44 and 52 post-therapy when compared to pre-therapy (when the mice did not have Ss). Restoration of salivary flow could have resulted from a combination of rescue and paracrine effects from BM cells. This study suggests that a combined immuno- and cell-based therapy can permanently prevent Ss and restored salivary function in NOD mice.},

abstract = {The association of the HLA complex on chromosome 6 does not explain total linkage of the HLA region to Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), leading to the hypothesis that there may be additional causal genes in the HLA region for immune-related disorders. Reports on the MHC Class I chain-related A (MICA) gene as candidate for association with T1D are contradicting. We investigated whether variation in MICA is associated to T1D in a cohort of 350 unrelated individuals with juvenile-onset T1D and 540 control subjects, followed by a meta-analysis of 14 studies. We also investigated an HLA-independent association for MICA with T1D. In our case-control study, we found that the MICA*A5 variant was significantly associated with an increased risk for T1D, while MICA*A6 was significantly associated with a decreased risk that was confirmed by our meta-analysis. However, the meta-analysis did not show an association of MICA*A5 T1D. Analysis of MICA alleles conditional on T1D-associated high-risk MHC class II haplotypes revealed that MICA*A6 was associated with an increased risk for T1D when this marker co-occurred with HLA DQ2DR17 T1D-risk-haplotypes. In contrast, MICA*A6 reduced the risk from the HLA DQ8DR4 T1D-risk haplotype. Moreover, MICA*A9 showed a significant association to increased risk for T1D on DQ8DR4 haplotypes. Co-inheritance of MICA*A6 with the HLA DQ2DR17 haplotype in T1D indicates this haplotype may carry the additional genetic factors for T1D, but our study does not support an independent association between MICA variants and T1D.},

Utilizing simple in vitro transcription and translation labeling of autoantigens, it is now possible to rapidly create fluid-phase radioassays for most (but not all) autoantigens, thereby allowing direct comparison between the different assay formats. In addition, adding a fluid-phase competition step to both solid-phase ELISA assays and even fluid-phase radioassays can enhance specificity. Development in a field of such assays with excellent specificity and sensitivity (e.g. studies of type 1A diabetes) is fostered by Societies sponsoring workshops where blinded samples are evaluated with ``competing'' assay formats for sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.},

Insulin resistance and obesity, together with the presence of markers of pancreatic autoimmunity -- namely, autoantibodies to islet cell antigens -- typically define this condition. However, recognition of double diabetes can pose problems. In most cases, a reduction in the `autoimmune load' and an increase in the `metabolic load' are helpful for attaining a correct diagnosis in a diabetic child.},

Treatment with either ligand at earlier stages of insulitis suppressed the development of T1D. Unlike Flt3-L, GM-CSF was more effective in suppressing T1D, even when administered at later stages of insulitis. In vitro studies and in vivo adoptive transfer experiments revealed that CD4+CD25+ T cells from GM-CSF-treated mice could suppress effector T cell response and T1D. This suppression is likely mediated through enhanced IL-10 and TGF-$\beta$1 production. Adoptive transfer of GM-CSF exposed DCs to naive mice resulted in an expansion of Foxp3+ T cells and a significant delay in T1D onset. Our results indicate that GM-CSF acted primarily on DCs and caused an expansion of Foxp3+ Tregs which delayed the onset of T1D in NOD mice.},

abstract = {In the past 50 years, immunologists have accumulated an amazing amount of information as to how the immune system functions. However, one of the most fundamental aspects of immunity, how the immune system discriminates between self vs. non-self, still remains an enigma. Any attempt to explain this most intriguing and fundamental characteristic must account for this decision at the level of the whole immune system, but as well, at the level of the individual cells making up the immune system. Moreover, it must provide for a molecular explanation as to how and why the cells behave as they do. The "Quantal Theory", proposed herein, is based upon the "Clonal Selection Theory", first proposed by Sir McFarland Burnet in 1955, in which he explained the remarkable specificity as well as diversity of recognition of everything foreign in the environment. The "Quantal Theory" is built upon Burnet's premise that after antigen selection of cell clones, a proliferative expansion of the selected cells ensues. Furthermore, it is derived from experiments which indicate that the proliferation of antigen-selected cell clones is determined by a quantal, "all-or-none", decision promulgated by a critical number of cellular receptors triggered by the T Cell Growth Factor (TCGF), interleukin 2 (IL2). An extraordinary number of experiments reported especially in the past 20 years, and detailed herein, indicate that the T cell Antigen Receptor (TCR) behaves similarly, and also that there are several critical numbers of triggered TCRs that determine different fates of the T cells. Moreover, the fates of the cells appear ultimately to be determined by the TCR triggering of the IL2 and IL2 receptor (IL2R) genes, which are also expressed in a very quantal fashion. The "Quantal Theory" states that the fundamental decisions of the T cell immune system are dependent upon the cells receiving a critical number of triggered TCRs and IL2Rs and that the cells respond in an all-or-none fashion. The "Quantal Theory" accounts fully for the development of T cells in the thymus, and such fundamental cellular fates as both "positive" and "negative" selection, as well as the decision to differentiate into a "Regulatory T cell" (T-Reg). In the periphery, the "Quantal Theory" accounts for the decision to proliferate or not in response to the presence of an antigen, either non-self or self, or to differentiate into a T-Reg. Since the immune system discriminates between self and non-self antigens by the accumulated number of triggered TCRs and IL2Rs, therapeutic manipulation of the determinants of these quantal decisions should permit new approaches to either enhance or dampen antigen-specific immune responses.},

abstract = {As the thymus involutes with age, the maintenance of peripheral naive T cells in humans becomes strongly dependent on peripheral cell division. However, mechanisms that orchestrate homeostatic division remain unclear. In this study we present evidence that the frequency of naive CD4 T cells that express CD25 (IL-2 receptor $\alpha$-chain) increases with age on subsets of both CD31(+) and CD31(-) naive CD4 T cells. Analyses of TCR excision circles from sorted subsets indicate that CD25(+) naive CD4 T cells have undergone more rounds of homeostatic proliferation than their CD25(-) counterparts in both the CD31(+) and CD31(-) subsets, indicating that CD25 is a marker of naive CD4 T cells that have preferentially responded to survival signals from self-Ags or cytokines. CD25 expression on CD25(-) naive CD4 T cells can be induced by IL-7 in vitro in the absence of TCR activation. Although CD25(+) naive T cells respond to lower concentrations of IL-2 as compared with their CD25(-) counterparts, IL-2 responsiveness is further increased in CD31(-) naive T cells by their expression of the signaling IL-2 receptor $\beta$-chain CD122, forming with common $\gamma$-chain functional high-affinity IL-2 receptors. CD25 plays a role during activation: CD25(+) naive T cells stimulated in an APC-dependent manner were shown to produce increased levels of IL-2 as compared with their CD25(-) counterparts. This study establishes CD25(+) naive CD4 T cells, which are further delineated by CD31 expression, as a major functionally distinct immune cell subset in humans that warrants further characterization in health and disease.},

We employed a tag single-nucleotide polymorphism (tag SNP) approach in large T1D sample collections consisting of 7,457 cases and controls and 725 multiplex families. Tag SNPs were analyzed using a multilocus test to provide a regional test for association. We found strong statistical evidence in the case-control collection (P=6.5x10(-8)) for a T1D locus in the CD25 region of chromosome 10p15 and replicated the association in the family collection (P=7.3x10(-3); combined P=1.3x10(-10)).

abstract = {Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signals influence various lymphocyte subsets during differentiation, immune responses and homeostasis. As discussed in this Review, stimulation with IL-2 is crucial for the maintenance of regulatory T (T(Reg)) cells and for the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells into defined effector T cell subsets following antigen-mediated activation. For CD8(+) T cells, IL-2 signals optimize both effector T cell generation and differentiation into memory cells. IL-2 is presented in soluble form or bound to dendritic cells and the extracellular matrix. Use of IL-2 - either alone or in complex with particular neutralizing IL-2-specific antibodies - can amplify CD8(+) T cell responses or induce the expansion of the T(Reg) cell population, thus favouring either immune stimulation or suppression.},

abstract = {The Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) format was developed back in 1984. Since then, FCS became the standard file format supported by all flow cytometry software and hardware vendors. Over the years, updates were incorporated to adapt to technological advancements in both flow cytometry and computing technologies. However, flexibility in how data may be stored in FCS has led to implementation difficulties for instrument vendors and third party software developers. In this technical note, we are providing implementation guidance and examples related to FCS 3.1, the latest version of the standard. By publishing this text, we intend to prevent potential compatibility issues that could be faced when implementing the FCS spillover and preferred display keywords that have arisen during discussions among some implementers. {\copyright} 2012 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.},

abstract = {T1D (type 1 diabetes) incidence rates are extremely low in Asian populations. The prevalences of islet-specific autoantibodies are reported to be low compared with Caucasians. Although the clinical and immunologic characteristics of T1D in Asians appear to be different from those of Caucasians, if we apply correct patient definition and standardized methods, the typical T1D patients are very similar, in the immunologic as well as genetic perspectives. Although the association of individual allele seems to be different between populations, if we compare the identical DR-DQ haplotypes, the association and transmission to diabetic offspring were similar for Asians and Caucasians. The high-risk HLA genotypes/haplotypes were found to be independent determinants of diabetes in the first-degree relatives of individuals with T1D, particularly in the presence of autoantibodies. A different genetic susceptibility including a low frequency of high-risk HLA alleles could explain the lower prevalence of islet-specific autoantibodies and the low incidence of T1D, or different genetic and environmental interactions might be involved in the etiology of T1D. It is certain that DR-DQ linkage disequilibrium (LD) is an important factor explaining the difference in T1D incidence in different countries. LD between highly susceptible DRB1 alleles and protective DQB1 alleles, and vice versa, is the major contributing factor to the low incidence of T1D in Asians. We also suggested that different genetic/environmental interactions might operate in the etiology of T1D between Caucasians and Asians. It would be of great help for primary prevention to investigate to what degree genetic determinants influence the well-known regional differences in incidences, since we can identify environmental risk factors that may either initiate the autoimmune process or promote already ongoing beta cell damage in different countries. For this, population-based epidemiological studies are necessary to identify risk determinants that may be useful for primary prevention strategies.},

abstract = {Finland has the world's highest incidence of type 1 diabetes, and it is steadily increasing. We determined concordance rates and estimated heritability for type 1 diabetes in the Finnish Twin Cohort, a population-based twin cohort of 22,650 twin pairs. In addition, we studied age of onset in the first affected twin and discordance time between concordant twin pairs. Finnish twins born between 1958 and 1986 were followed for type 1 diabetes until 1998. We identified 228 twin pairs with type 1 diabetes: 44 monozygotic (MZ), 183 dizygotic (DZ), and 1 pair with unknown zygosity. The pairwise concordance for type 1 diabetes was 27.3% (95% CI 22.8-31.8) in MZ and 3.8% (2.7-4.9) in DZ twins. The probandwise concordance was 42.9% (26.7-59.2) and 7.4% (2.2-12.6), respectively. The longest discordance times were 6.9 years among concordant MZ twins and 23.6 years among DZ twins. The risk for type 1 diabetes was highest in cotwins of the index twins diagnosed at a very young age. The model with additive genetic and individual environmental effects was the best-fitting liability model, with 88% of phenotypic variance due to genetic factors and the remaining variance due to unshared environmental factors. In conclusion, these nationwide twin data demonstrated high genetic liability for type 1 diabetes. Early-onset diabetes increases the risk in cotwins. However, the majority of affected MZ twin pairs remain discordant for type 1 diabetes.},

Protein-protein interaction mapping projects that follow stringent criteria, coupled with experimental validation in orthogonal systems, provide high-confidence data sets immanently useful for interrogating developmental and disease mechanisms at a system level as well as elucidating individual protein function and interactome network topology. Although far from complete, currently available maps provide insight into how biochemical properties of proteins and protein complexes are integrated into biological systems. Such maps are also a useful resource to predict the function(s) of thousands of genes.},

In PuPy tract sequences, triplex formation occurs readily under physiological conditions, leaving single-stranded DNAs capable of hybridization with complementary single-stranded DNAs and RNAs. The formation of single-strands and transmolecular triplexes is thought to enable sequences spaced distantly along the genome to associate with each other and organize nuclear DNA into ordered configurations. Triplex-forming DNAs in the human interphase nucleus were analyzed by combining fluorescence in situ "nondenaturing" hybridization employing PuPy tract probes and immunodetection by antitriplex antibodies. The nondenaturing hybridization technique, which has been used to detect RNA, may detect single-stranded DNAs in nondenatured nuclei, if present. Probes such as (GA/TC)(n) and (GAA/TTC)(n) sequences gave sequence-specific signals that overlapped with or were closely associated with triplexes immunolocalized by using known antitriplex antibodies. Pretreatment of nuclei with antitriplex antibodies blocked probe signal formation. Signal formation was resistant to pretreatment of nuclei with RNases but sensitive to single strand-specific nucleases. Triplexes visualized differentially with distinct PuPy tract probes were associated spatially with centromeric sequences in the interphase nucleus in a sequence-specific manner.},

LncRNAs have been shown to play key roles in various biological processes such as imprinting control, circuitry controlling pluripotency and differentiation, immune responses and chromosome dynamics. Notably, a growing number of lncRNAs have been implicated in disease etiology. With the increasing number of published lncRNA studies, the experimental data on lncRNAs (e.g. expression profiles, molecular features and biological functions) have accumulated rapidly. In order to enable a systematic compilation and integration of this information, we have updated the NONCODE database (http://www.noncode.org) to version 3.0 to include the first integrated collection of expression and functional lncRNA data obtained from re-annotated microarray studies in a single database. NONCODE has a user-friendly interface with a variety of search or browse options, a local Genome Browser for visualization and a BLAST server for sequence-alignment search. In addition, NONCODE provides a platform for the ongoing collation of ncRNAs reported in the literature. All data in NONCODE are open to users, and can be downloaded through the website or obtained through the SOAP API and DAS services.},

abstract = {Alternative promoters within the same gene are a general phenomenon in gene expression. Mechanisms of their selective regulation vary from one gene to another and are still poorly understood. Here we show that in quiescent cells the mechanism of transcriptional repression of the major promoter of the gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase depends on a non-coding transcript initiated from the upstream minor promoter and involves both the direct interaction of the RNA and promoter-specific interference. The specificity and efficiency of repression is ensured by the formation of a stable complex between non-coding RNA and the major promoter, direct interaction of the non-coding RNA with the general transcription factor IIB and dissociation of the preinitiation complex from the major promoter. By using in vivo and in vitro assays such as inducible and reconstituted transcription, RNA bandshifts, RNA interference, chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation, we show that the regulatory transcript produced from the minor promoter has a critical function in an epigenetic mechanism of promoter-specific transcriptional repression.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, techniques have been developed that have allowed the study of transcriptomes without bias from previous genome annotations, which has led to the discovery of a plethora of unexpected RNAs that have no obvious coding capacities. There are many different kinds of products that are generated by this pervasive transcription; this Review focuses on small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that have been found to be associated with promoters in eukaryotes from animals to yeast. After comparing the different classes of such ncRNAs described in various studies, the Review discusses how the models proposed for their origins and their possible functions challenge previous views of the basic transcription process and its regulation.},

abstract = {Recent data from several organisms indicate that the transcribed portions of genomes are larger and more complex than expected, and that many functional properties of transcripts are based not on coding sequences but on regulatory sequences in untranslated regions or non-coding RNAs. Alternative start and polyadenylation sites and regulation of intron splicing add additional dimensions to the rich transcriptional output. This transcriptional complexity has been sampled mainly using hybridization-based methods under one or few experimental conditions. Here we applied direct high-throughput sequencing of complementary DNAs (RNA-Seq), supplemented with data from high-density tiling arrays, to globally sample transcripts of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, independently from available gene annotations. We interrogated transcriptomes under multiple conditions, including rapid proliferation, meiotic differentiation and environmental stress, as well as in RNA processing mutants to reveal the dynamic plasticity of the transcriptional landscape as a function of environmental, developmental and genetic factors. High-throughput sequencing proved to be a powerful and quantitative method to sample transcriptomes deeply at maximal resolution. In contrast to hybridization, sequencing showed little, if any, background noise and was sensitive enough to detect widespread transcription in >90% of the genome, including traces of RNAs that were not robustly transcribed or rapidly degraded. The combined sequencing and strand-specific array data provide rich condition-specific information on novel, mostly non-coding transcripts, untranslated regions and gene structures, thus improving the existing genome annotation. Sequence reads spanning exon-exon or exon-intron junctions give unique insight into a surprising variability in splicing efficiency across introns, genes and conditions. Splicing efficiency was largely coordinated with transcript levels, and increased transcription led to increased splicing in test genes. Hundreds of introns showed such regulated splicing during cellular proliferation or differentiation.},

abstract = {In mammals, dosage compensation is achieved by X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in the female. The noncoding Xist gene initiates silencing of the X chromosome, whereas its antisense partner Tsix blocks silencing. The complementarity of Xist and Tsix RNAs has long suggested a role for RNA interference (RNAi). Here, we report that murine Xist and Tsix form duplexes in vivo. During XCI, the duplexes are processed to small RNAs (sRNAs), most likely on the active X (Xa) in a Dicer-dependent manner. Deleting Dicer compromises sRNA production and derepresses Xist. Furthermore, without Dicer, Xist RNA cannot accumulate and histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation is blocked on the inactive X (Xi). The defects are partially rescued by truncating Tsix. Thus, XCI and RNAi intersect, down-regulating Xist on Xa and spreading silencing on Xi.},

abstract = {The availability of sequenced genomes from 12 Drosophila species has enabled the use of comparative genomics for the systematic discovery of functional elements conserved within this genus. We have developed quantitative metrics for the evolutionary signatures specific to protein-coding regions and applied them genome-wide, resulting in 1193 candidate new protein-coding exons in the D. melanogaster genome. We have reviewed these predictions by manual curation and validated a subset by directed cDNA screening and sequencing, revealing both new genes and new alternative splice forms of known genes. We also used these evolutionary signatures to evaluate existing gene annotations, resulting in the validation of 87% of genes lacking descriptive names and identifying 414 poorly conserved genes that are likely to be spurious predictions, noncoding, or species-specific genes. Furthermore, our methods suggest a variety of refinements to hundreds of existing gene models, such as modifications to translation start codons and exon splice boundaries. Finally, we performed directed genome-wide searches for unusual protein-coding structures, discovering 149 possible examples of stop codon readthrough, 125 new candidate ORFs of polycistronic mRNAs, and several candidate translational frameshifts. These results affect >10% of annotated fly genes and demonstrate the power of comparative genomics to enhance our understanding of genome organization, even in a model organism as intensively studied as Drosophila melanogaster.},

Here, we present evidence of widespread divergent transcription at protein-encoding gene promoters. Transcription start site-associated RNAs (TSSa-RNAs) nonrandomly flank active promoters, with peaks of antisense and sense short RNAs at 250 nucleotides upstream and 50 nucleotides downstream of TSSs, respectively. Northern analysis shows that TSSa-RNAs are subsets of an RNA population 20 to 90 nucleotides in length. Promoter-associated RNAPII and H3K4-trimethylated histones, transcription initiation hallmarks, colocalize at sense and antisense TSSa-RNA positions; however, H3K79-dimethylated histones, characteristic of elongating RNAPII, are only present downstream of TSSs. These results suggest that divergent transcription over short distances is common for active promoters and may help promoter regions maintain a state poised for subsequent regulation.},

abstract = {Long transcripts that do not encode protein have only rarely been the subject of experimental scrutiny. Presumably, this is owing to the current lack of evidence of their functionality, thereby leaving an impression that, instead, they represent "transcriptional noise." Here, we describe an analysis of 3122 long and full-length, noncoding RNAs ("macroRNAs") from the mouse, and compare their sequences and their promoters with orthologous sequence from human and from rat. We considered three independent signatures of purifying selection related to substitutions, sequence insertions and deletions, and splicing. We find that the evolution of the set of noncoding RNAs is not consistent with neutralist explanations. Rather, our results indicate that purifying selection has acted on the macroRNAs' promoters, primary sequence, and consensus splice site motifs. Promoters have experienced the greatest elimination of nucleotide substitutions, insertions, and deletions. The proportion of conserved sequence (4.1%-5.5%) in these macroRNAs is comparable to the density of exons within protein-coding transcripts (5.2%). These macroRNAs, taken together, thus possess the imprint of purifying selection, thereby indicating their functionality. Our findings should now provide an incentive for the experimental investigation of these macroRNAs' functions.},

abstract = {Expression of Snail1 in epithelial cells triggers an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we demonstrate that the synthesis of Zeb2, a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin, is up-regulated after Snail1-induced EMT. Snail1 does not affect the synthesis of Zeb2 mRNA, but prevents the processing of a large intron located in its 5'-untranslated region (UTR). This intron contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) necessary for the expression of Zeb2. Maintenance of 5'-UTR Zeb2 intron is dependent on the expression of a natural antisense transcript (NAT) that overlaps the 5' splice site in the intron. Ectopic overexpression of this NAT in epithelial cells prevents splicing of the Zeb2 5'-UTR, increases the levels of Zeb2 protein, and consequently down-regulates E-cadherin mRNA and protein. The relevance of these results is demonstrated by the strong association between NAT presence and conservation of the 5'-UTR intron in cells that have undergone EMT or in human tumors with low E-cadherin expression. Therefore, the results presented in this article reveal the existence of a NAT capable of activating Zeb2 expression, explain the mechanism involved in this activation, and demonstrate that this NAT regulates E-cadherin expression.},

abstract = {Non-coding (nc)RNAs are key players in numerous biological processes such as gene regulation, chromatin domain formation and genome stability. Large ncRNAs interact with histone modifiers and are involved in cancer development, X-chromosome inactivation and autosomal gene imprinting. However, despite recent evidence showing that pervasive transcription is more widespread than previously thought, only a few examples mediating gene regulation in eukaryotes have been described. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the bona-fide regulatory ncRNAs are destabilized by the Xrn1 5'-3' RNA exonuclease (also known as Kem1), but the genome-wide characterization of the entire regulatory ncRNA family remains elusive. Here, using strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we identify a novel class of 1,658 Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcripts (XUTs) in which 66% are antisense to open reading frames. These transcripts are polyadenylated and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-dependent. The majority of XUTs strongly accumulate in lithium-containing media, indicating that they might have a role in adaptive responses to changes in growth conditions. Notably, RNAPII chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of Xrn1-deficient strains revealed a significant decrease of RNAPII occupancy over 273 genes with antisense XUTs. These genes show an unusual bias for H3K4me3 marks and require the Set1 histone H3 lysine 4 methyl-transferase for silencing. Furthermore, abolishing H3K4me3 triggers the silencing of other genes with antisense XUTs, supporting a model in which H3K4me3 antagonizes antisense ncRNA repressive activity. Our results demonstrate that antisense ncRNA-mediated regulation is a general regulatory pathway for gene expression in S. cerevisiae.},

abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is known by its aggressiveness and lack of effective therapeutic options. Thus, improvement in current knowledge of molecular changes associated with pancreatic cancer is urgently needed to explore novel venues of diagnostics and treatment of this dismal disease. While there is mounting evidence that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) transcribed from intronic and intergenic regions of the human genome may play different roles in the regulation of gene expression in normal and cancer cells, their expression pattern and biological relevance in pancreatic cancer is currently unknown. In the present work we investigated the relative abundance of a collection of lncRNAs in patients' pancreatic tissue samples aiming at identifying gene expression profiles correlated to pancreatic cancer and metastasis.Custom 3,355-element spotted cDNA microarray interrogating protein-coding genes and putative lncRNA were used to obtain expression profiles from 38 clinical samples of tumor and non-tumor pancreatic tissues. Bioinformatics analyses were performed to characterize structure and conservation of lncRNAs expressed in pancreatic tissues, as well as to identify expression signatures correlated to tissue histology. Strand-specific reverse transcription followed by PCR and qRT-PCR were employed to determine strandedness of lncRNAs and to validate microarray results, respectively.We show that subsets of intronic/intergenic lncRNAs are expressed across tumor and non-tumor pancreatic tissue samples. Enrichment of promoter-associated chromatin marks and over-representation of conserved DNA elements and stable secondary structure predictions suggest that these transcripts are generated from independent transcriptional units and that at least a fraction is under evolutionary selection, and thus potentially functional.Statistically significant expression signatures comprising protein-coding mRNAs and lncRNAs that correlate to PDAC or to pancreatic cancer metastasis were identified. Interestingly, loci harboring intronic lncRNAs differentially expressed in PDAC metastases were enriched in genes associated to the MAPK pathway. Orientation-specific RT-PCR documented that intronic transcripts are expressed in sense, antisense or both orientations relative to protein-coding mRNAs. Differential expression of a subset of intronic lncRNAs (PPP3CB, MAP3K14 and DAPK1 loci) in metastatic samples was confirmed by Real-Time PCR.Our findings reveal sets of intronic lncRNAs expressed in pancreatic tissues whose abundance is correlated to PDAC or metastasis, thus pointing to the potential relevance of this class of transcripts in biological processes related to malignant transformation and metastasis in pancreatic cancer.},

abstract = {Noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) participate in epigenetic regulation but are poorly understood. Here we characterize the transcriptional landscape of the four human HOX loci at five base pair resolution in 11 anatomic sites and identify 231 HOX ncRNAs that extend known transcribed regions by more than 30 kilobases. HOX ncRNAs are spatially expressed along developmental axes and possess unique sequence motifs, and their expression demarcates broad chromosomal domains of differential histone methylation and RNA polymerase accessibility. We identified a 2.2 kilobase ncRNA residing in the HOXC locus, termed HOTAIR, which represses transcription in trans across 40 kilobases of the HOXD locus. HOTAIR interacts with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and is required for PRC2 occupancy and histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation of HOXD locus. Thus, transcription of ncRNA may demarcate chromosomal domains of gene silencing at a distance; these results have broad implications for gene regulation in development and disease states.},

abstract = {Recent interest in the non-coding transcriptome has resulted in the identification of large numbers of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian genomes, most of which have not been functionally characterized. Computational exploration of the potential functions of these lncRNAs will therefore facilitate further work in this field of research. We have developed a practical and user-friendly web interface called ncFANs (non-coding RNA Function ANnotation server), which is the first web service for functional annotation of human and mouse lncRNAs. On the basis of the re-annotated Affymetrix microarray data, ncFANs provides two alternative strategies for lncRNA functional annotation: one utilizing three aspects of a coding-non-coding gene co-expression (CNC) network, the other identifying condition-related differentially expressed lncRNAs. ncFANs introduces a highly efficient way of re-using the abundant pre-existing microarray data. The present version of ncFANs includes re-annotated CDF files for 10 human and mouse Affymetrix microarrays, and the server will be continuously updated with more re-annotated microarray platforms and lncRNA data. ncFANs is freely accessible at http://www.ebiomed.org/ncFANs/ or http://www.noncode.org/ncFANs/.},

abstract = {It has been postulated that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are involved in the posttranscriptional control of gene expression, and may have contributed to the emergence of the complex attributes observed in mammalians. We show here that the complement of ncRNAs expressed from intronic regions of the human and mouse genomes comprises at least 78,147 and 39,660 transcriptional units, respectively. To identify conserved intronic sequences expressed in both humans and mice, we used custom-designed human cDNA microarrays to separately interrogate RNA from mouse and human liver, kidney, and prostate tissues. An overlapping tissue expression signature was detected for both species, comprising 198 transcripts; among these, 22 RNAs map to intronic regions with evidence of evolutionary conservation in humans and mice. Transcription of selected human-mouse intronic ncRNAs was confirmed using strand-specific RT-PCR. Altogether, these results support an evolutionarily conserved role of intronic ncRNAs in human and mouse, which are likely to be involved in the fine tuning of gene expression regulation in different mammalian tissues.},

abstract = {The human genome contains thousands of long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) transcribed from diverse genomic locations. A large set of long ncRNAs is transcribed independent of protein-coding genes. We have used the GENCODE annotation of the human genome to identify 3019 long ncRNAs expressed in various human cell lines and tissue. This set of long ncRNAs responds to differentiation signals in primary human keratinocytes and is coexpressed with important regulators of keratinocyte development. Depletion of a number of these long ncRNAs leads to the repression of specific genes in their surrounding locus, supportive of an activating function for ncRNAs. Using reporter assays, we confirmed such activating function and show that such transcriptional enhancement is mediated through the long ncRNA transcripts. Our studies show that long ncRNAs exhibit functions similar to classically defined enhancers, through an RNA-dependent mechanism.},

abstract = {To equalize X-chromosome dosages between the sexes, the female mammal inactivates one of her two X chromosomes. X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is initiated by expression of Xist, a 17-kb noncoding RNA (ncRNA) that accumulates on the X in cis. Because interacting factors have not been isolated, the mechanism by which Xist induces silencing remains unknown. We discovered a 1.6-kilobase ncRNA (RepA) within Xist and identified the Polycomb complex, PRC2, as its direct target. PRC2 is initially recruited to the X by RepA RNA, with Ezh2 serving as the RNA binding subunit. The antisense Tsix RNA inhibits this interaction. RepA depletion abolishes full-length Xist induction and trimethylation on lysine 27 of histone H3 of the X. Likewise, PRC2 deficiency compromises Xist up-regulation. Therefore, RepA, together with PRC2, is required for the initiation and spread of XCI. We conclude that a ncRNA cofactor recruits Polycomb complexes to their target locus.},

abstract = {The identification of ultraconserved noncoding sequences in vertebrates has been associated with developmental regulators and DNA-binding proteins. One of the first of these was identified in the intergenic region between the Dlx-5 and Dlx-6 genes, members of the Dlx/dll homeodomain-containing protein family. In previous experiments, we showed that Sonic hedgehog treatment of forebrain neural explants results in the activation of Dlx-2 and the novel noncoding RNA (ncRNA), Evf-1. In this report, we show that the Dlx-5/6 ultraconserved region is transcribed to generate an alternatively spliced form of Evf-1, the ncRNA Evf-2. Evf-2 specifically cooperates with Dlx-2 to increase the transcriptional activity of the Dlx-5/6 enhancer in a target and homeodomain-specific manner. A stable complex containing the Evf-2 ncRNA and the Dlx-2 protein forms in vivo, suggesting that the Evf-2 ncRNA activates transcriptional activity by directly influencing Dlx-2 activity. These experiments identify a novel mechanism whereby transcription is controlled by the cooperative actions of an ncRNA and a homeodomain protein. The possibility that a subset of vertebrate ultraconserved regions may function at both the DNA and RNA level to control key developmental regulators may explain why ultraconserved sequences exhibit 90% or more conservation even after 450 million years of vertebrate evolution.},

abstract = {Transcription in mammalian cells can be assessed at a genome-wide level, but it has been difficult to reliably determine whether individual transcripts are derived from the plus or minus strands of chromosomes. This distinction can be critical for understanding the relationship between known transcripts (sense) and the complementary antisense transcripts that may regulate them. Here, we describe a technique that can be used to (i) identify the DNA strand of origin for any particular RNA transcript, and (ii) quantify the number of sense and antisense transcripts from expressed genes at a global level. We examined five different human cell types and in each case found evidence for antisense transcripts in 2900 to 6400 human genes. The distribution of antisense transcripts was distinct from that of sense transcripts, was nonrandom across the genome, and differed among cell types. Antisense transcripts thus appear to be a pervasive feature of human cells, which suggests that they are a fundamental component of gene regulation.},

abstract = {Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a diverse class of transcripts that structurally resemble mRNAs but do not encode proteins. Recent genome-wide studies in humans and the mouse have annotated lncRNAs expressed in cell lines and adult tissues, but a systematic analysis of lncRNAs expressed during vertebrate embryogenesis has been elusive. To identify lncRNAs with potential functions in vertebrate embryogenesis, we performed a time-series of RNA-seq experiments at eight stages during early zebrafish development. We reconstructed 56,535 high-confidence transcripts in 28,912 loci, recovering the vast majority of expressed RefSeq transcripts while identifying thousands of novel isoforms and expressed loci. We defined a stringent set of 1133 noncoding multi-exonic transcripts expressed during embryogenesis. These include long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs), intronic overlapping lncRNAs, exonic antisense overlapping lncRNAs, and precursors for small RNAs (sRNAs). Zebrafish lncRNAs share many of the characteristics of their mammalian counterparts: relatively short length, low exon number, low expression, and conservation levels comparable to that of introns. Subsets of lncRNAs carry chromatin signatures characteristic of genes with developmental functions. The temporal expression profile of lncRNAs revealed two novel properties: lncRNAs are expressed in narrower time windows than are protein-coding genes and are specifically enriched in early-stage embryos. In addition, several lncRNAs show tissue-specific expression and distinct subcellular localization patterns. Integrative computational analyses associated individual lncRNAs with specific pathways and functions, ranging from cell cycle regulation to morphogenesis. Our study provides the first systematic identification of lncRNAs in a vertebrate embryo and forms the foundation for future genetic, genomic, and evolutionary studies.},

These terms have appeared as ncRNAs until recently have been ignored by expression profiling and cDNA annotation projects and their mode of action is diverse (e.g. influencing chromatin structure and epigenetics, translational silencing, transcriptional silencing).

However, little is known about ncRNA expression during meiotic development. Using high-resolution profiling we identified an extensive meiotic ncRNA expression program interlaced with the protein-coding transcriptome via sense/antisense transcript pairs, bidirectional promoters, and ncRNAs that overlap the regulatory regions of genes. Meiotic unannotated transcripts (MUTs) are mitotic targets of the conserved exosome component Rrp6, which itself is degraded after the onset of meiosis when MUTs and other ncRNAs accumulate in successive waves. Diploid cells lacking Rrp6 fail to initiate premeiotic DNA replication normally and cannot undergo efficient meiotic development. The present study demonstrates a unique function for budding yeast Rrp6 in degrading distinct classes of meiotically induced ncRNAs during vegetative growth and the onset of meiosis and thus points to a critical role of differential ncRNA expression in the execution of a conserved developmental program.},

Noncoding RNAs are divided into short noncoding RNAs (including microRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). We defined complementary DNAs (cDNAs) lacking any positive-strand open reading frames (ORFs) longer than 30 amino acids, as well as cDNAs lacking any evidence of interspecies conservation of their longer-than-30-amino acid ORFs, as noncoding. We have identified 5446 lncRNA genes in the human genome from approximately 24,000 full-length cDNAs, using our new ORF-prediction pipeline. We combined them nonredundantly with lncRNAs from four published sources to derive 6736 lncRNA genes. In an effort to distinguish standalone and antisense lncRNA genes from database artifacts, we stratified our catalog of lncRNAs according to the distance between each lncRNA gene candidate and its nearest known protein-coding gene. We concurrently examined the protein-coding capacity of known genes overlapping with lncRNAs. Remarkably, 62% of known genes with "hypothetical protein" names actually lacked protein-coding capacity. This study has greatly expanded the known human lncRNA catalog, increased its accuracy through manual annotation of cDNA-to-genome alignments, and revealed that a large set of hypothetical-protein genes in GenBank lacks protein-coding capacity. In addition, we have developed, independently of existing NCBI tools, command-line programs with high-throughput ORF-finding and BLASTP-parsing functionality, suitable for future automated assessments of protein-coding capacity of novel transcripts.},

abstract = {Janeway's Immunobiology, Seventh Edition is an introductory text for use in immunology courses for undergraduates, graduate students and medical students. It guides the reader through the immune system in all its aspects - from the first engagement of innate immunity to the generation of the adaptive immune response and its clinical consequences. The Seventh Edition has been comprehensively updated throughout, and includes new information on topics such as NK cells, Toll-like receptors, AID, viral evasins, mucosal immunity, and celiac disease, to name a few. Each copy of the book includes a revised CD-ROM, Immunobiology Interactive, which contains animations and videos with voiceover narration, as well as the figures from the text for presentation purposes. Janeway's Immunobiology continues to set the standard for currency and authority with its clear writing style and organization, full-color art program, scientific accuracy and consistent viewpoint - that of the host's interaction with an environment containing many species of potentially harmful microorganisms.},

abstract = {RNA is not only a messenger operating between DNA and protein. Transcription of essentially the entire eukaryotic genome generates a myriad of non-protein-coding RNA species that show complex overlapping patterns of expression and regulation. Although long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are among the least well-understood of these transcript species, they cannot all be dismissed as merely transcriptional "noise." Here, we review the evolution of lncRNAs and their roles in transcriptional regulation, epigenetic gene regulation, and disease.},

abstract = {Genes and proteins generate molecular circuitry that enables the cell to process information and respond to stimuli. A major challenge is to identify characteristic patterns in this network of interactions that may shed light on basic cellular mechanisms. Previous studies have analyzed aspects of this network, concentrating on either transcription-regulation or protein-protein interactions. Here we search for composite network motifs: characteristic network patterns consisting of both transcription-regulation and protein-protein interactions that recur significantly more often than in random networks. To this end we developed algorithms for detecting motifs in networks with two or more types of interactions and applied them to an integrated data set of protein-protein interactions and transcription regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found a two-protein mixed-feedback loop motif, five types of three-protein motifs exhibiting coregulation and complex formation, and many motifs involving four proteins. Virtually all four-protein motifs consisted of combinations of smaller motifs. This study presents a basic framework for detecting the building blocks of networks with multiple types of interactions.},

abstract = {The genome of Mycoplasma pneumoniae is among the smallest found in self-replicating organisms. To study the basic principles of bacterial proteome organization, we used tandem affinity purification-mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) in a proteome-wide screen. The analysis revealed 62 homomultimeric and 116 heteromultimeric soluble protein complexes, of which the majority are novel. About a third of the heteromultimeric complexes show higher levels of proteome organization, including assembly into larger, multiprotein complex entities, suggesting sequential steps in biological processes, and extensive sharing of components, implying protein multifunctionality. Incorporation of structural models for 484 proteins, single-particle electron microscopy, and cellular electron tomograms provided supporting structural details for this proteome organization. The data set provides a blueprint of the minimal cellular machinery required for life.},

abstract = {The past few years in the medical and biological sciences have been characterized by the advent of systems biology. However, despite the well-known connectivity between the molecules described by transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic approaches, few studies have tried to correlate parameters across the various levels of systemic description. When comparing the discriminatory power of metabolic and RNA profiling to distinguish between different potato tuber systems, using the techniques described here suggests that metabolic profiling has a higher resolution than expression profiling. When applying pairwise transcript-metabolite correlation analyses, 571 of the 26,616 possible pairs showed significant correlation, most of which was novel and included several strong correlations to nutritionally important metabolites. We believe this approach to be of high potential value in the identification of candidate genes for modifying the metabolite content of biological systems.},

abstract = {Early diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism is commonly performed through biofluid metabolomics, which detects specific metabolic biomarkers whose concentration is altered due to genomic mutations. The identification of new biomarkers is of major importance to biomedical research and is usually performed through data mining of metabolomic data. After the recent publication of the genome-scale network model of human metabolism, we present a novel computational approach for systematically predicting metabolic biomarkers in stochiometric metabolic models. Applying the method to predict biomarkers for disruptions of red-blood cell metabolism demonstrates a marked correlation with altered metabolic concentrations inferred through kinetic model simulations. Applying the method to the genome-scale human model reveals a set of 233 metabolites whose concentration is predicted to be either elevated or reduced as a result of 176 possible dysfunctional enzymes. The method's predictions are shown to significantly correlate with known disease biomarkers and to predict many novel potential biomarkers. Using this method to prioritize metabolite measurement experiments to identify new biomarkers can provide an order of a 10-fold increase in biomarker detection performance.},

abstract = {Metabolism of glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in brain, is complex and of paramount importance to overall brain function. Thus, understanding the regulation of enzymes involved in formation and disposal of glutamate and related metabolites is crucial to understanding glutamate metabolism. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is a pivotal enzyme that links amino acid metabolism and TCA cycle activity in brain and other tissues. The allosteric regulation of GDH has been extensively studied and characterized. Less is known about the influence of lipid modifications on GDH activity, and the participation of GDH in transient heteroenzyme complexes (metabolons) that can greatly influence metabolism by altering kinetic parameters and lead to channeling of metabolites. This review summarizes evidence for palmitoylation and acylation of GDH, information on protein binding, and information regarding the participation of GDH in transient heteroenzyme complexes. Recent studies suggest that a number of other proteins can bind to GDH altering activity and overall metabolism. It is likely that these modifications and interactions contribute additional levels of regulation of GDH activity and glutamate metabolism.},

abstract = {Kinetic data on a number of protein-protein associations have provided evidence for the initial formation of a pre-equilibrium encounter complex that subsequently relaxes to the final stereospecific complex. Site-directed mutagenesis and brownian dynamics simulations have suggested that the rate of association can be modulated by perturbations in charge distribution outside the direct interaction surfaces. Furthermore, rate enhancement through non-specific binding may occur by either a reduction in dimensionality or the presence of a short-range, non-specific attractive potential. Here, using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, we directly demonstrate the existence and visualize the distribution of an ensemble of transient, non-specific encounter complexes under equilibrium conditions for a relatively weak protein-protein complex between the amino-terminal domain of enzyme I and the phosphocarrier protein HPr. Neither the stereospecific complex alone nor any single alternative conformation can account fully for the intermolecular paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data. Restrained rigid-body simulated annealing refinement against the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement data enables us to obtain an atomic probability distribution map of the non-specific encounter complex ensemble that qualitatively correlates with the electrostatic surface potentials on the interacting proteins. Qualitatively similar results are presented for two other protein-protein complexes.},

How this allosteric modulation occurs--the pathways of communication, the shifting of conformational ensembles and the altered molecular dynamics--has received considerable attention during the past two years. Recent progress has helped outline the molecular origins of allostery in proteins as diverse as Hsp70 molecular chaperones and signal integrating proteins, such as WASP. In addition, allosteric properties have been successfully engineered into proteins for drug design or the development of novel biosensors. Methodological advances have provided exciting prospects for new insights and new biological roles of allosteric systems have been uncovered.},

abstract = {Research on mapping diabetes-susceptibility genes is dependent on several factors, including the existence of a single major gene for susceptibility, genetic homogeneity, and the existence of appropriate clinical material. The power to detect susceptibility genes is dependent on the risks in relatives and the distance of genetic markers from the susceptibility genes. For insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), the best-fitting risk models are those with a single major locus with residual polygenic factors. The major locus effect is likely represented by genes in the HLA complex, because specific genotypes have been found to affect IDDM risk significantly. Thus, mapping the remaining polygenic IDDM susceptibility factors--each of small effect--is a difficult and long task. For non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the likely risk models result in few genes with moderate effect. Models of NIDDM have significant residual polygenic variation remaining, reflecting the importance of multiple loci with small effect, environmental effects, or genetic heterogeneity; however, the prospects for mapping genes that provide at least moderate susceptibility for NIDDM now appear promising.},

However, the identification of a biologically interpretable and universally shared set of markers proved to be difficult. Here, we propose a method for de novo grouping of genes by dissecting the protein-protein interaction network into disjoint sub networks using pair wise gene expression correlation measures. We show that the obtained sub networks are functionally coherent and are consistently identified when applied on a compendium composed of six different breast cancer studies. Application of the proposed method using different integration approaches underlines the robustness of the identified sub network related to cell cycle and identifies putative new sub network markers for metastasis related to cell-cell adhesion, the proteasome complex and JUN-FOS signalling. Although gene selection with the proposed method does not directly improve upon previously reported cross study classification performances, it shows great promises for applications in data integration and result interpretation.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Revealing the subcellular localization of proteins within membrane-bound compartments is of a major importance for inferring protein function. Though current high-throughput localization experiments provide valuable data, they are costly and time-consuming, and due to technical difficulties not readily applicable for many Eukaryotes. Physical characteristics of proteins, such as sequence targeting signals and amino acid composition are commonly used to predict subcellular localizations using computational approaches. Recently it was shown that protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks can be used to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of protein subcellular localization. However, as high-throughput PPI data depend on costly high-throughput experiments and are currently available for only a few organisms, the scope of such methods is yet limited. RESULTS: This study presents a novel constraint-based method for predicting subcellular localization of enzymes based on their embedding metabolic network, relying on a parsimony principle of a minimal number of cross-membrane metabolite transporters. In a cross-validation test of predicting known subcellular localization of yeast enzymes, the method is shown to be markedly robust, providing accurate localization predictions even when only 20% of the known enzyme localizations are given as input. It is shown to outperform pathway enrichment-based methods both in terms of prediction accuracy and in its ability to predict the subcellular localization of entire metabolic pathways when no a-priori pathway-specific localization data is available (and hence enrichment methods are bound to fail). With the number of available metabolic networks already reaching more than 600 and growing fast, the new method may significantly contribute to the identification of enzyme localizations in many different organisms.},

The network size is constantly expanding as larger volume of information and omics data are further integrated into the biological networks previously built upon a single type of data. Such effort more recently led to the modeling of human metabolic network and prediction of its tissue-specific metabolism, reconstruction of consensus yeast metabolic network, and simulation of mutual interactions among multiple microorganisms. It is expected that this trend will continue, the outcomes of which will allow development of more sophisticated networks integrating diverse omics data, and enhance our understanding of biological systems.},

Contrasting genetic effects of KIR/HLA combinations have been observed in infectious and autoimmune diseases, where genotypes associated with NK cell activation seem to be protective or to confer susceptibility, respectively. We show here that combinations of KIR and HLA loci also affect the risk of developing cervical neoplasia. Specific inhibitory KIR/HLA ligand pairs decrease the risk of developing neoplasia, whereas the presence of the activating receptor KIR3DS1 results in increased risk of disease, particularly when the protective inhibitory combinations are missing. These data suggest a continuum of resistance conferred by NK cell inhibition to susceptibility involving NK cell activation in the development of cervical neoplasia and underscore the pervasive influence of KIR/HLA genetic variation in human disease pathogenesis.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: A wealth of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data has recently become available. These data are organized as PPI networks and an efficient and biologically meaningful method to compare such PPI networks is needed. As a first step, we would like to compare observed networks to established network models, under the aspect of small subgraph counts, as these are conjectured to relate to functional modules in the PPI network. We employ the software tool GraphCrunch with the Graphlet Degree Distribution Agreement (GDDA) score to examine the use of such counts for network comparison. RESULTS: Our results show that the GDDA score has a pronounced dependency on the number of edges and vertices of the networks being considered. This should be taken into account when testing the fit of models. We provide a method for assessing the statistical significance of the fit between random graph models and biological networks based on non-parametric tests. Using this method we examine the fit of Erd\\"o\s-R\\'e\nyi (ER), ER with fixed degree distribution and geometric (3D) models to PPI networks. Under these rigorous tests none of these models fit to the PPI networks. The GDDA score is not stable in the region of graph density relevant to current PPI networks. We hypothesize that this score instability is due to the networks under consideration having a graph density in the threshold region for the appearance of small subgraphs. This is true for both geometric (3D) and ER random graph models. Such threshold behaviour may be linked to the robustness and efficiency properties of the PPI networks.},

abstract = {Understanding why some cellular components are conserved across species but others evolve rapidly is a key question of modern biology. Here we show that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, proteins organized in cohesive patterns of interactions are conserved to a substantially higher degree than those that do not participate in such motifs. We find that the conservation of proteins in distinct topological motifs correlates with the interconnectedness and function of that motif and also depends on the structure of the overall interactome topology. These findings indicate that motifs may represent evolutionary conserved topological units of cellular networks molded in accordance with the specific biological function in which they participate.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a multifactorial and chronic autoimmune disease caused by the deficiency of insulin synthesis and or by its secretion or action defects. Genetic and environmental factors are known to be involved in its pathogenesis. The human leukocyte antigen complex (human leukocyte antigen (HLA)) constitutes the most relevant region contributing with 50% of the inherited risk for T1D. Natural killer cells (NK) are part of the innate immune system recognizing class I HLA molecules on target cells through their membrane receptors, called killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). The aim of our study is to evaluate the association between the KIR genes and HLA alleles in patients with T1D and healthy controls. Two hundred forty-eight T1D patients and 250 healthy controls were typed for HLA and KIR genes by PCR-SSP. Our results showed an increase of C2 in controls (p = 0.002). The genotype 2DL1/C2+ was also more common in controls (p = 0.001), as well as haplotype association KIR2DL2/DR3/DR4+ and the combination with only DR3+ (p {\&}lt; 0.001; p {\&}lt; 0.001). The maximum protection was seen when KIR2DL2/DR3-were absent when the combination of KIR2DL1/C2+ were present (p {\&}lt; 0.001) and the maximum risk was observed when KIR2DL2/DR3/DR4+ were present in the absence of KIR2DL1/C2- (p = 0.005). Our results confirmed the association of the KIR2DL2/DR3 increasing risk for T1D and suggest a protective role of KIR2DL1/C2.},

It is also diverse in terms of the partners' affinity for each other, with K(d) ranging between 10(-5) and 10(-14) M. Nine pairs of entries represent closely related complexes that have a similar structure, but a very different affinity, each pair comprising a cognate and a noncognate assembly. The unbound structures of the component proteins being available, conformation changes can be assessed. They are significant in most of the complexes, and large movements or disorder-to-order transitions are frequently observed. The set may be used to benchmark biophysical models aiming to relate affinity to structure in protein-protein interactions, taking into account the reactants and the conformation changes that accompany the association reaction, instead of just the final product.},

Here we use polychromatic flow cytometry to show that differences in surface expression of the human interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor alpha (IL2RA, or CD25) protein are restricted to particular immune cell types and correlate with several haplotypes in the IL2RA region that have previously been associated with two autoimmune diseases, type 1 diabetes (T1D) and multiple sclerosis. We confirm our strongest gene-phenotype correlation at the RNA level by allele-specific expression (ASE). We also define key parameters for the design and implementation of post-GWAS gene-phenotype investigations and demonstrate the usefulness of a large bioresource of genotype-selectable normal donors from whom fresh, primary cells can be analyzed.},

Here, we characterize interactions by using atomic-resolution information from three-dimensional protein structures. We find that some previously recognized relationships between network topology and genomic features (e.g., hubs tending to be essential proteins) are actually more reflective of a structural quantity, the number of distinct binding interfaces. Subdividing hubs with respect to this quantity provides insight into their evolutionary rate and indicates that additional mechanisms of network growth are active in evolution (beyond effective preferential attachment through gene duplication).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:In immunofluorescence measurements and most other flow cytometry applications, fluorescence signals of interest can range down to essentially zero. After fluorescence compensation, some cell populations will have low means and include events with negative data values. Logarithmic presentation has been very useful in providing informative displays of wide-ranging flow cytometry data, but it fails to adequately display cell populations with low means and high variances and, in particular, offers no way to include negative data values. This has led to a great deal of difficulty in interpreting and understanding flow cytometry data, has often resulted in incorrect delineation of cell populations, and has led many people to question the correctness of compensation computations that were, in fact, correct.

RESULTS:We identified a set of criteria for creating data visualization methods that accommodate the scaling difficulties presented by flow cytometry data. On the basis of these, we developed a new data visualization method that provides important advantages over linear or logarithmic scaling for display of flow cytometry data, a scaling we refer to as "Logicle" scaling. Logicle functions represent a particular generalization of the hyperbolic sine function with one more adjustable parameter than linear or logarithmic functions. Finally, we developed methods for objectively and automatically selecting an appropriate value for this parameter.

CONCLUSIONS:The Logicle display method provides more complete, appropriate, and readily interpretable representations of data that includes populations with low-to-zero means, including distributions resulting from fluorescence compensation procedures, than can be produced using either logarithmic or linear displays. The method includes a specific algorithm for evaluating actual data distributions and deriving parameters of the Logicle scaling function appropriate for optimal display of that data. It is critical to note that Logicle visualization does not change the data values or the descriptive statistics computed from them.},

We performed multiple high-throughput measurements to study the response of Escherichia coli cells to genetic and environmental perturbations. Analysis of metabolic enzyme gene disruptants revealed unexpectedly small changes in messenger RNA and proteins for most disruptants. Overall, metabolite levels were also stable, reflecting the rerouting of fluxes in the metabolic network. In contrast, E. coli actively regulated enzyme levels to maintain a stable metabolic state in response to changes in growth rate. E. coli thus seems to use complementary strategies that result in a metabolic network robust against perturbations.},

Cells use signaling pathways and regulatory mechanisms to coordinate multiple processes, allowing them to respond to and adapt to an ever-changing environment. The large number of components, the degree of interconnectivity and the complex control of cellular networks are becoming evident in the integrated genomic and proteomic analyses that are emerging. It is increasingly recognized that the understanding of properties that arise from whole-cell function require integrated, theoretical descriptions of the relationships between different cellular components. Recent theoretical advances allow us to describe cellular network structure with graph concepts and have revealed organizational features shared with numerous non-biological networks. We now have the opportunity to describe quantitatively a network of hundreds or thousands of interacting components. Moreover, the observed topologies of cellular networks give us clues about their evolution and how their organization influences their function and dynamic responses.},

To better understand and eventually design transient protein-protein interactions (TPPIs), a molecular perspective of the protein-protein interfaces is necessary. Obtaining high-quality structures of protein-protein interactions could be one way of achieving this goal. After introducing the association kinetics of TPPIs, we elaborate on the experimental techniques detecting TPPIs in combination with the computational methods which classify transient and/or non-obligate complexes. In this review, currently available databases and servers that can be used to identify and predict TPPIs are also compiled.},

Network models suggest that partial inhibition of a surprisingly small number of targets can be more efficient than the complete inhibition of a single target. This and the success stories of multi-target drugs and combinatorial therapies led us to suggest that systematic drug-design strategies should be directed against multiple targets. We propose that the final effect of partial, but multiple, drug actions might often surpass that of complete drug action at a single target. The future success of this novel drug-design paradigm will depend not only on a new generation of computer models to identify the correct multiple targets and their multi-fitting, low-affinity drug candidates but also on more-efficient in vivo testing.},

In energy terms water and chaperones were suggested to decrease the activation energy between various local energy minima smoothing the energy landscape, rescuing misfolded proteins from conformational traps and stabilizing their native structure. In kinetic terms water and chaperones may make the punctuated equilibrium of conformational changes less punctuated and help protein relaxation. Finally, water and chaperones may help the convergence of multiple energy landscapes during protein-macromolecule interactions. We also discuss the possibility of the introduction of protein games to narrow the multitude of the energy landscapes when a protein binds to another macromolecule. Both water and chaperones provide a diffuse set of rapidly fluctuating weak links (low affinity and low probability interactions), which allow the generalization of all these statements to a multitude of networks.},

Many predictive methods use information from related proteins. Accordingly, we review the conservation of interface and ligand binding sites within protein families and their association with conserved residues and Specificity Determining Positions. We then review recent developments in predictive methods for the identification of PPIs, protein interface sites and small molecule ligand binding sites.

To what extent do protein interactions act as constraints during evolution of the protein sequence? How does the type of interaction, specifically transient or obligate, play into these constraints? Are the mutations in the binding site of an interacting protein correlated with mutations in the binding site of its partner? We address these and other questions by relying on a carefully curated dataset of protein complex structures. Results point to the importance of distinguishing between transient and obligate interactions. We conclude that residues in the interfaces of obligate complexes tend to evolve at a relatively slower rate, allowing them to coevolve with their interacting partners. In contrast, the plasticity inherent in transient interactions leads to an increased rate of substitution for the interface residues and leaves little or no evidence of correlated mutations across the interface.},

abstract = {The ability to map protein-protein interactions has grown tremendously over the last few years, making it possible to envision the mapping of whole or targeted protein interaction networks and to elucidate their temporal dynamics. The use of mass spectrometry for the study of protein complexes has proven to be an invaluable tool due to its ability to unambiguously identify proteins from a variety of biological samples. Furthermore, when affinity purification is combined with mass spectrometry analysis, the identification of multimeric protein complexes is greatly facilitated. Here, we review recent developments for the analysis of protein interaction networks by mass spectrometry and discuss the integration of different bioinformatic tools for predicting, validating, and managing interaction datasets.},

abstract = {The network paradigm is based on the derivation of emerging properties of studied systems by their representation as oriented graphs: any system is traced back to a set of nodes (its constituent elements) linked by edges (arcs) correspondent to the relations existing between the nodes. This allows for a straightforward quantitative formalization of systems by means of the computation of mathematical descriptors of such graphs (graph theory). The network paradigm is particularly useful when it is clear which elements of the modelled system must play the role of nodes and arcs respectively, and when topological constraints have a major role with respect to kinetic ones. In this review we demonstrate how nodes and arcs of protein topology are characterized at different levels of definition: 1. Recurrence matrix of hydrophobicity patterns along the sequence 2. Contact matrix of alpha carbons of 3D structures 3. Correlation matrix of motions of different portion of the molecule in molecular dynamics. These three conditions represent different but potentially correlated reticular systems that can be profitably analysed by means of network analysis tools.},

The graph abstraction of protein interactions is crucial for understanding the global behaviour of the network. In this mini review, we summarize basic graph topological properties, such as node degree and betweenness, and their relation to essentiality and modularity of protein interactions. The classification of hub proteins into date and party hubs with distinct properties has significant implications for relating topological properties to the behaviour of the network. We emphasize that the integration of protein interface structure into interaction graph models provides a better explanation of hub proteins, and strengthens the relationship between the role of the hubs in the cell and their topological properties.},

Although individual analysis of each of these omics data undoubtedly results into interesting findings, it is only by integrating them that gaining a global insight into cellular behaviour can be aimed at. A systems approach thus is predicated on data integration. However, because of the complexity of biological systems and the specificities of the data-generating technologies (noisiness, heterogeneity, etc.), integrating omics data in an attempt to reconstruct signalling networks is not trivial. Developing its methodologies constitutes a major research challenge. Besides for their intrinsic value towards health care, environment and industry, prokaryotes are ideal model systems to further develop these methods because of their lower regulatory complexity compared with eukaryotes, and the ease with which they can be manipulated. Several successful examples outlined in this review already show the potential of the systems approach for both fundamental and industrial applications, which would be time-consuming or impossible to develop solely through traditional reductionist approaches.},

These protein-protein interactions are of high relevance for many biological functions. In addition to many well established protein complexes an increasing number of protein-protein interactions, which form rather transient complexes has recently been discovered. The formation of such complexes seems to be a common feature especially for metabolic pathways. In the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis, we identified a protein complex of three citric acid cycle enzymes. This complex consists of the citrate synthase, the isocitrate dehydrogenase, and the malate dehydrogenase. Moreover, fumarase and aconitase interact with malate dehydrogenase and with each other. These five enzymes catalyze sequential reaction of the TCA cycle. Thus, this interaction might be important for a direct transfer of intermediates of the TCA cycle and thus for elevated metabolic fluxes via substrate channeling. In addition, we discovered a link between the TCA cycle and gluconeogenesis through a flexible interaction of two proteins: the association between the malate dehydrogenase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is directly controlled by the metabolic flux. The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase links the TCA cycle with gluconeogenesis and is essential for B. subtilis growing on gluconeogenic carbon sources. Only under gluconeogenic growth conditions an interaction of these two proteins is detectable and disappears under glycolytic growth conditions.},

abstract = {Determining protein interaction networks and predicting network changes in time and space are crucial to understanding and modeling a biological system. In the past few years, the combination of experimental and computational tools has allowed great progress toward reaching this goal. Experimental methods include the large-scale determination of protein interactions using two-hybrid or pull-down analysis as well as proteomics. The latter one is especially valuable when changes in protein concentrations over time are recorded. Computational tools include methods to predict and validate protein interactions on the basis of structural information and bioinformatics tools that analyze and integrate data for the same purpose. In this review, we focus on the use of structural information in combination with computational tools to predict new protein interactions, to determine which interactions are compatible with each other, to obtain some functional insight into single and multiple mutations, and to estimate equilibrium and kinetic parameters. Finally, we discuss the importance of establishing criteria to biologically validate protein interactions.},

abstract = {The metabolic syndrome, inborn errors of metabolism, and drug-induced changes to metabolic states all bring about a seemingly bewildering array of alterations in metabolite concentrations; these often occur in tissues and cells that are distant from those containing the primary biochemical lesion. How is it possible to collect sufficient biochemical information from a patient to enable us to work backwards and pinpoint the primary lesion, and possibly treat it in this whole human metabolic network? Potential analyses have benefited from modern methods such as ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and more. A yet greater challenge is the prediction of outcomes of possible modern therapies using drugs and genetic engineering. This exposes the notion of viewing metabolism from a completely different perspective, with focus on the enzymes, regulators, and structural elements that are encoded by genes that specify the amino acid sequences, and hence encode the various interactions, be they regulatory or catalytic. The mainstream view of metabolism is being challenged, so we discuss here the reconciling of traditionally quantitative chemocentric metabolism with the seemingly 'parameter-free' genomic description, and vice versa.},

We detected 117 previously undescribed, mostly noncoding transcripts, 89 of them in antisense configuration to known genes. We identified 341 operons, of which 139 are polycistronic; almost half of the latter show decaying expression in a staircase-like manner. Under various conditions, operons could be divided into 447 smaller transcriptional units, resulting in many alternative transcripts. Frequent antisense transcripts, alternative transcripts, and multiple regulators per gene imply a highly dynamic transcriptome, more similar to that of eukaryotes than previously thought.},

abstract = {Significant insight about biological networks arises from the study of network motifs--overly abundant network subgraphs--but such wiring patterns do not specify when and how potential routes within a cellular network are used. To address this limitation, we introduce activity motifs, which capture patterns in the dynamic use of a network. Using this framework to analyze transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism, we find that cells use different timing activity motifs to optimize transcription timing in response to changing conditions: forward activation to produce metabolic compounds efficiently, backward shutoff to rapidly stop production of a detrimental product and synchronized activation for co-production of metabolites required for the same reaction. Measuring protein abundance over a time course reveals that mRNA timing motifs also occur at the protein level. Timing motifs significantly overlap with binding activity motifs, where genes in a linear chain have ordered binding affinity to a transcription factor, suggesting a mechanism for ordered transcription. Finely timed transcriptional regulation is therefore abundant in yeast metabolism, optimizing the organism's adaptation to new environmental conditions.},

For example, diverse transcriptomic and gene copy number variation data are currently collected for various cancers, but relatively few current methods are capable to utilise the emerging information.Methods:We developed and tested a data-integration method to identify gene networks that drive the biology of breast cancer clinical subtypes. The method simultaneously overlays gene expression and gene copy number data on protein-protein interaction, transcriptional-regulatory and signalling networks by identifying coincident genomic and transcriptional disturbances in local network neighborhoods.Results:We identified distinct driver-networks for each of the three common clinical breast cancer subtypes: oestrogen receptor (ER)+, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+, and triple receptor-negative breast cancers (TNBC) from patient and cell line data sets. Driver-networks inferred from independent datasets were significantly reproducible. We also confirmed the functional relevance of a subset of randomly selected driver-network members for TNBC in gene knockdown experiments in vitro. We found that TNBC driver-network members genes have increased functional specificity to TNBC cell lines and higher functional sensitivity compared with genes selected by differential expression alone.Conclusion:Clinical subtype-specific driver-networks identified through data integration are reproducible and functionally important.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 16 February 2012; doi:10.1038/bjc.2011.584 www.bjcancer.com.},

We summarize available data how central network elements are enriched in active centers and ligand binding sites directing the dynamics of the entire protein. We assess the feasibility of conformational and energy networks to simplify the vast complexity of rugged energy landscapes and to predict protein folding and dynamics.

Numerous studies have sought differences between hubs and non-hubs to explain what makes a protein a hub and how a shared hub-binding site can be promiscuous, yet at the same time be specific. Here, we suggest that the problem is largely non-existent and resides in the popular representation of protein interaction networks: protein products derived from a single gene, even if different, are clustered in maps into a single node. This leads to the impression that a single protein binds to a very large number of partners. In reality, it does not; rather, protein networks reflect the combination of multiple proteins, each with a distinct conformation.},

However, despite the key role of these networks in sustaining cellular functions, their large-scale structure is essentially unknown. Here we present a systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains of life. We show that, despite significant variation in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks have the same topological scaling properties and show striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems. This may indicate that metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but also complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.},

Quantitative proteomic and corresponding transcriptomic data were analysed with Voronoi treemaps linking functional classification and relative expression changes of gene products according to their fate in the stationary phase. The obtained data comprise the first comprehensive profiling of changes in the membrane subfraction and allow in-depth analysis of major physiological processes, including monitoring of protein degradation.},

abstract = {In Arabidopsis thaliana, enzymes of glycolysis are present on the surface of mitochondria and free in the cytosol. The functional significance of this dual localization has now been established by demonstrating that the extent of mitochondrial association is dependent on respiration rate in both Arabidopsis cells and potato (Solanum tuberosum) tubers. Thus, inhibition of respiration with KCN led to a proportional decrease in the degree of association, whereas stimulation of respiration by uncoupling, tissue ageing, or overexpression of invertase led to increased mitochondrial association. In all treatments, the total activity of the glycolytic enzymes in the cell was unaltered, indicating that the existing pools of each enzyme repartitioned between the cytosol and the mitochondria. Isotope dilution experiments on isolated mitochondria, using (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to monitor the impact of unlabeled glycolytic intermediates on the production of downstream intermediates derived from (13)C-labeled precursors, provided direct evidence for the occurrence of variable levels of substrate channeling. Pull-down experiments suggest that interaction with the outer mitochondrial membrane protein, VDAC, anchors glycolytic enzymes to the mitochondrial surface. It appears that glycolytic enzymes associate dynamically with mitochondria to support respiration and that substrate channeling restricts the use of intermediates by competing metabolic pathways.},

abstract = {Systematic mapping of protein-protein interactions, or 'interactome' mapping, was initiated in model organisms, starting with defined biological processes and then expanding to the scale of the proteome. Although far from complete, such maps have revealed global topological and dynamic features of interactome networks that relate to known biological properties, suggesting that a human interactome map will provide insight into development and disease mechanisms at a systems level. Here we describe an initial version of a proteome-scale map of human binary protein-protein interactions. Using a stringent, high-throughput yeast two-hybrid system, we tested pairwise interactions among the products of approximately 8,100 currently available Gateway-cloned open reading frames and detected approximately 2,800 interactions. This data set, called CCSB-HI1, has a verification rate of approximately 78% as revealed by an independent co-affinity purification assay, and correlates significantly with other biological attributes. The CCSB-HI1 data set increases by approximately 70% the set of available binary interactions within the tested space and reveals more than 300 new connections to over 100 disease-associated proteins. This work represents an important step towards a systematic and comprehensive human interactome project.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:It is well known that genotyping error adversely affects the power of genetic case-control association studies but there is little research on its effects on type I error, and none that has addressed possible differences in genotype error rates between cases and controls.

METHODS:We used simulations to examine the influence of genotyping error on the type I error probability given by case-control studies. The effect of genotyping error on the magnitude of type I error was explored for a single marker of varying minor allele frequency (MAF), and for haplotypic tests based on two markers with varying MAF and linkage disequilibrium (LD) measure r(2).

RESULTS:We show that even with low genotyping error rates (<0.01), systematic differences in the error rate between samples can result in type I error rates substantially above 0.05. The effect was maximal for markers with small MAF, markers in strong LD, and where a common allele is more frequently misclassified as a rare allele than vice versa. The problem was also exacerbated by the use of large samples.

CONCLUSIONS:Our results show that small differential genotyping error rates between cases and controls pose significant problems for association analyses. Differential genotyping error rates are particularly likely to arise where genotype data are combined from multiple sites, or where case genotypes are examined against archived reference population cohort genotypes that are being generated in several countries. Although these strategies may be necessary to obtain adequately powered samples, our data show the importance of stringent quality control. Furthermore, associations based on rare haplotypes should be treated with caution.},

abstract = {Precise coupling of spatially separated intracellular ATP-producing and ATP-consuming processes is fundamental to the bioenergetics of living organisms, ensuring a fail-safe operation of the energetic system over a broad range of cellular functional activities. Here, we provide an overview of the role of spatially arranged enzymatic networks, catalyzed by creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, carbonic anhydrase and glycolytic enzymes, in efficient high-energy phosphoryl transfer and signal communication in the cell. Studies of transgenic creatine kinase and adenylate kinase deficient mice, along with pharmacological targeting of individual enzymes, have revealed the importance of near-equilibrium reactions in the dissipation of metabolite gradients and communication of energetic signals to distinct intracellular compartments, including the cell nucleus and membrane metabolic sensors. Enzymatic capacities, isoform distribution and the dynamics of net phosphoryl flux through the integrated phosphotransfer systems tightly correlate with cellular functions, indicating a critical role of such networks in efficient energy transfer and distribution, thereby securing the cellular economy and energetic homeostasis under stress.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The success of molecular systems biology hinges on the ability to use computational models to design predictive experiments, and ultimately unravel underlying biological mechanisms. A problem commonly encountered in the computational modelling of biological networks is that alternative, structurally different models of similar complexity fit a set of experimental data equally well. In this case, more than one molecular mechanism can explain available data. In order to rule out the incorrect mechanisms, one needs to invalidate incorrect models. At this point, new experiments maximizing the difference between the measured values of alternative models should be proposed and conducted. Such experiments should be optimally designed to produce data that are most likely to invalidate incorrect model structures. RESULTS: In this paper we develop methodologies for the optimal design of experiments with the aim of discriminating between different mathematical models of the same biological system. The first approach determines the 'best' initial condition that maximizes the L2 (energy) distance between the outputs of the rival models. In the second approach, we maximize the L2-distance of the outputs by designing the optimal external stimulus (input) profile of unit L2-norm. Our third method uses optimized structural changes (corresponding, for example, to parameter value changes reflecting gene knock-outs) to achieve the same goal. The numerical implementation of each method is considered in an example, signal processing in starving Dictyostelium amoebae. CONCLUSIONS: Model-based design of experiments improves both the reliability and the efficiency of biochemical network model discrimination. This opens the way to model invalidation, which can be used to perfect our understanding of biochemical networks. Our general problem formulation together with the three proposed experiment design methods give the practitioner new tools for a systems biology approach to experiment design.},

abstract = {It has recently been demonstrated that many biological networks exhibit a "scale-free" topology, for which the probability of observing a node with a certain number of edges (k) follows a power law: i.e., p(k) approximately k(-gamma). This observation has been reproduced by evolutionary models. Here we consider the network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and demonstrate that two published independent measurements of these interactions produce graphs that are only weakly correlated with one another despite their strikingly similar topology. We then propose a physical model based on the fundamental principle that (de)solvation is a major physical factor in PPIs. This model reproduces not only the scale-free nature of such graphs but also a number of higher-order correlations in these networks. A key support of the model is provided by the discovery of a significant correlation between the number of interactions made by a protein and the fraction of hydrophobic residues on its surface. The model presented in this paper represents a physical model for experimentally determined PPIs that comprehensively reproduces the topological features of interaction networks. These results have profound implications for understanding not only PPIs but also other types of scale-free networks.},

abstract = {Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) catabolism follows sequential reactions and their metabolites intersect with other metabolic pathways. The initial enzymes in BCAA metabolism, the mitochondrial branched-chain aminotransferase (BCATm), which deaminates the BCAAs to branched-chain $\alpha$-keto acids (BCKAs); and the branched-chain $\alpha$-keto acid dehydrogenase enzyme complex (BCKDC), which oxidatively decarboxylates the BCKAs, are organized in a supramolecular complex termed metabolon. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH1) is found in the metabolon in rat tissues. Bovine GDH1 binds to the pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP)-form of human BCATm (PMP-BCATm) but not to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-BCATm in vitro. This protein interaction facilitates reamination of the $\alpha$-ketoglutarate ($\alpha$KG) product of the GDH1 oxidative deamination reaction. Human GDH1 appears to act like bovine GDH1 but human GDH2 does not show the same enhancement of BCKDC enzyme activities. Another metabolic enzyme is also found in the metabolon is pyruvate carboxylase (PC). Kinetic results suggest that PC binds to the E1 decarboxylase of BCKDC but does not effect BCAA catabolism. The protein interaction of BCATm and GDH1 promotes regeneration of PLP-BCATm which then binds to BCKDC resulting in channeling of the BCKA products from BCATm first half reaction to E1 and promoting BCAA oxidation and net nitrogen transfer from BCAAs. The cycling of nitrogen through glutamate via the actions of BCATm and GDH1 releases free ammonia. Formation of ammonia may be important for astrocyte glutamine synthesis in the central nervous system. In peripheral tissue association of BCATm and GDH1 would promote BCAA oxidation at physiologically relevant BCAA concentrations.},

abstract = {Cellular functions of proteins are strongly influenced by their interactions with other proteins. The frequency of protein interactions is a function of the local concentration of two proteins and their affinity for one another. When two proteins are tethered together, the link between them influences their effective concentrations and therefore the frequency of their interaction. Currently no methods exist to systematically vary the effective concentration within this intramolecular interaction. Here we outline a modular, genetically encoded linker, namely, an ER/K [genetically encoded polypeptide motif based on alternating sequence of approximately four glutamic acid (E) followed by approximately four arginine (R) or lysine (K) residues] single $\alpha$-helix that can be used to regulate the frequency of interaction between two proteins, or between a protein and a peptide, one at each end. We exploit the wide range of interaction affinities between calmodulin and its binding peptides, combined with FRET to determine the effect of the ER/K $\alpha$-helix in regulating protein interactions. We find that increasing the length of the ER/K $\alpha$-helix reduces the on rate of the intramolecular interaction without significantly affecting the off rate, regardless of the affinity of the bimolecular interaction. We outline a genetically encoded approach to determine the dissociation constant for both moderate (micromolar K(d)) and strong (nanomolar K(d)) protein interactions. Our studies demonstrate the use of the ER/K $\alpha$-helix to systematically engineer FRET biosensors that detect changes in concentration or affinity of interacting proteins, and modulate enzyme autoinhibition. Our findings are consistent with the ER/K $\alpha$-helix as a worm-like chain with rare, stochastic breaks in the helix backbone that may account for the behavior of myosin VI stepping along actin.},

Recently, the KIR3DS1 allele has been shown to slow progression to AIDS in individuals expressing HLA-Bw4 with isoleucine at position 80. However, due to the lack of a specific Ab, KIR3DS1 expression and function is not well characterized. In this study, we demonstrate KIR3DS1 expression on a substantial subset of peripheral natural killer cells through its recognition by the mAb Z27. The fidelity of this detection method was confirmed by analysis of KIR3DS1 transfectants and the identification of a novel KIR3DS1 null allele. Interestingly, KIR3DS1 is also expressed by a small proportion of CD56(+) T cells. We show that ligation of KIR3DS1 by Z27 leads to NK cell IFN-gamma production and degranulation as assessed by expression of CD107a. Furthermore, we document the persistence of KIR3DS1(+) NK cells in HIV-1 viremic patients. The high frequency of KIR3DS1 expression, along with its ability to activate NK cells, and its maintenance during HIV-1 viremia are consistent with the epidemiological data suggesting a critical role for this receptor in controlling HIV-1 pathogenesis.},

We compare four available databases that approximate the protein interaction network of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, aiming to uncover the network's generic large-scale properties and the impact of the proteins' function and cellular localization on the network topology. We show how each database supports a scale-free, topology with hierarchical modularity, indicating that these features represent a robust and generic property of the protein interactions network. We also find strong correlations between the network's structure and the functional role and subcellular localization of its protein constituents, concluding that most functional and/or localization classes appear as relatively segregated subnetworks of the full protein interaction network. The uncovered systematic differences between the four protein interaction databases reflect their relative coverage for different functional and localization classes and provide a guide for their utility in various bioinformatics studies.},

Sequence variation in KIR3DL1 and KIR3DL2 appear distinct; recombination is more evident in KIR3DL1, and point mutation is more evident in KIR3DL2. The KIR3DL1 genotype correlates well with levels of DX9 binding by NK cells, but not with the frequency of DX9-binding cells. Different KIR3DL1 alleles determine high, low, and no binding of DX9 Ab. Consequently, heterozygotes for high and low binding KIR3DL1 alleles have distinct subpopulations of NK cells that bind DX9 at high and low levels, giving characteristic bimodal distributions in flow cytometry. The Z27 Ab gave binding patterns similar to those of DX9. Four KIR3DL1 alleles producing high DX9 binding phenotypes were distinguished from four alleles producing low or no binding phenotypes by substitution at one or more of four positions in the encoded protein: 182 and 283 in the extracellular Ig-like domains, 320 in the transmembrane region, and 373 in the cytoplasmic tail.},

This review describes recent results obtained by using the atomic force microscope, optical tweezers, the surface force apparatus, and micropipette aspiration to quantify short-range protein-ligand interactions and the long-range, nonspecific forces that together control protein behavior. The examples presented illustrate the power of force measurements to quantify directly the force fields and energies that control protein behavior.},

abstract = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6 is associated with susceptibility to more common diseases than any other region of the human genome, including almost all disorders classified as autoimmune. In type 1 diabetes the major genetic susceptibility determinants have been mapped to the MHC class II genes HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 (refs 1-3), but these genes cannot completely explain the association between type 1 diabetes and the MHC region. Owing to the region's extreme gene density, the multiplicity of disease-associated alleles, strong associations between alleles, limited genotyping capability, and inadequate statistical approaches and sample sizes, which, and how many, loci within the MHC determine susceptibility remains unclear. Here, in several large type 1 diabetes data sets, we analyse a combined total of 1,729 polymorphisms, and apply statistical methods-recursive partitioning and regression-to pinpoint disease susceptibility to the MHC class I genes HLA-B and HLA-A (risk ratios >1.5; P(combined) = 2.01 x 10(-19) and 2.35 x 10(-13), respectively) in addition to the established associations of the MHC class II genes. Other loci with smaller and/or rarer effects might also be involved, but to find these, future searches must take into account both the HLA class II and class I genes and use even larger samples. Taken together with previous studies, we conclude that MHC-class-I-mediated events, principally involving HLA-B*39, contribute to the aetiology of type 1 diabetes.},

Three major categories of relations are shown to be significantly enriched in disordered proteins: gene expression, protein binding and to a lesser degree, protein phosphorylation. Finally we find that relations involving protein activation and to some extent inhibition are characterized by low disorder content.},

Complexes typically are merely the sum of their parts. A particularly interesting type of complex is the metabolon, containing enzymes within the same metabolic pathway. There is reasonably good evidence that metabolons exist, but they have not been detected using high-thoughput assays, possibly because of their fragility.},

abstract = {The integration of molecular interaction networks with other types of data, such as gene expression and structural features, can elicit more information than the simple node-and-edge representations commonly used. For example, the mapping of structural data onto interactions enables classification of proteins as singlish-interface and multi-interface hubs (those with 1 or 2 binding interfaces, and those with more than 2 interfaces, respectively). Similarly, interactions can be classified as permanent, wherein the interface is used by only one partner, or transient, wherein the interface is used by multiple partners, thereby resulting in mutually exclusive binding. Here, we incorporate another dimension into protein interactions: dynamic conformational changes of the participating proteins. We parse the entire PDB for alternate conformations of proteins in two different species, and map the structural dynamics of the interfacial region(s) onto the interaction network to compile the first version of Dynamic Structural Interaction Network (DynaSIN). We then use this to perform downstream analysis of the networks in the context of experimentally determined 3D protein structures and their conformational dynamics. We show that multi-interface hubs display a greater degree of conformational change than do singlish-interface hubs, and are thus are more plastic, which helps them to employ more interfaces for interactions. We also find that transient associations involve smaller conformational changes than do permanent interactions. While this may at first appear counter-intuitive, we explain this by proposing that, since proteins involved in transient interactions shuttle between interchangeable associations, they interact with domains that are similar to each other, and thus, do not entail drastic structural changes and the associated energetic requirements are lower. We provide evidence for this hypothesis by showing that interfaces involved in transient interactions bind fewer classes of domains than do those in a control set.},

abstract = {Drugs are devised to enter into the metabolism of an organism in order to produce a desired effect. From the chemical point of view, cellular metabolism is constituted by a complex network of reactions transforming metabolites one in each other. Knowledge on the structure of this network could help to develop novel methods for drug design, and to comprehend the root of known unexpected side effects. Many large-scale studies on the structure of metabolic networks have been developed following models based on different kinds of graphs as the fundamental image of the reaction network. Graphs models, however, comport wrong assumptions regarding the structure of reaction networks that may lead into wrong conclusions if they are not taken into account. In this article we critically review some graph-theoretical approaches to the analysis of centrality, vulnerability and modularity of metabolic networks, analyzing their limitations in estimating these key network properties, consider some proposals explicit or implicitly based on directed hypergraphs regarding their ability to overcome these issues, and review some recent implementation improvements that make the application of these models in increasingly large networks a viable option.},

abstract = {The Database of Protein Disorder (DisProt) links structure and function information for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Intrinsically disordered proteins do not form a fixed three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions, either in their entireties or in segments or regions. We define IDP as a protein that contains at least one experimentally determined disordered region. Although lacking fixed structure, IDPs and regions carry out important biological functions, being typically involved in regulation, signaling and control. Such functions can involve high-specificity low-affinity interactions, the multiple binding of one protein to many partners and the multiple binding of many proteins to one partner. These three features are all enabled and enhanced by protein intrinsic disorder. One of the major hindrances in the study of IDPs has been the lack of organized information. DisProt was developed to enable IDP research by collecting and organizing knowledge regarding the experimental characterization and the functional associations of IDPs. In addition to being a unique source of biological information, DisProt opens doors for a plethora of bioinformatics studies. DisProt is openly available at http://www.disprot.org.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions create the macromolecular assemblies and sequential signaling pathways essential for cell function. Their number far exceeds the number of proteins themselves and their experimental characterization, while improving, remains relatively slow. For these reasons, novel computational methods have important roles to play in understanding the physical basis of protein interactions, and in constraining the molecular basis of their specificity. This paper discusses methods based on multiple sequence alignments of protein homologues and phylogenetic trees.},

abstract = {The nuclei of differentiating cells exhibit several fundamental principles of self-organization. They are composed of many dynamical units connected physically and functionally to each other-a complex network-and the different parts of the system are mutually adapted and produce a characteristic end state. A unique cell-specific signature emerges over time from complex interactions among constituent elements that delineate coordinate gene expression and chromosome topology. Each element itself consists of many interacting components, all dynamical in nature. Self-organizing systems can be simplified while retaining complex information using approaches that examine the relationship between elements, such as spatial relationships and transcriptional information. These relationships can be represented using well-defined networks. We hypothesize that during the process of differentiation, networks within the cell nucleus rewire according to simple rules, from which a higher level of order emerges. Studying the interaction within and among networks provides a useful framework for investigating the complex organization and dynamic function of the nucleus.},

This review concentrates on the new applications of ITC in protein folding and misfolding, its traditional application in protein interactions, and an overview of what can be achieved in the field of protein science using this method and what developments are likely to occur in the near future.

Besides verification, integration of expression and interaction data is employed to provide functional annotation for over 300 previously uncharacterized genes. The robustness of these approaches is demonstrated by experiments that test the in silico predictions made. This study shows how integration improves the utility of different types of functional genomic data and how well this contributes to functional annotation.},

More than 1300 growth curves were recorded in the presence of various nutrient concentrations. Measurements of biomass indicators, metabolites, and 13C-glucose experiments provided information on directionality, fluxes, and energetics; integration with transcription profiling enabled the global analysis of metabolic regulation. Compared with more complex bacteria, the M. pneumoniae metabolic network has a more linear topology and contains a higher fraction of multifunctional enzymes; general features such as metabolite concentrations, cellular energetics, adaptability, and global gene expression responses are similar, however.},

abstract = {Recent advances in various 'omics' technologies enable quantitative monitoring of the abundance of various biological molecules in a high-throughput manner, and thus allow determination of their variation between different biological states on a genomic scale. Several popular 'omics' platforms that have been used in microbial systems biology include transcriptomics, which measures mRNA transcript levels; proteomics, which quantifies protein abundance; metabolomics, which determines abundance of small cellular metabolites; interactomics, which resolves the whole set of molecular interactions in cells; and fluxomics, which establishes dynamic changes of molecules within a cell over time. However, no single 'omics' analysis can fully unravel the complexities of fundamental microbial biology. Therefore, integration of multiple layers of information, the multi-'omics' approach, is required to acquire a precise picture of living micro-organisms. In spite of this being a challenging task, some attempts have been made recently to integrate heterogeneous 'omics' datasets in various microbial systems and the results have demonstrated that the multi-'omics' approach is a powerful tool for understanding the functional principles and dynamics of total cellular systems. This article reviews some basic concepts of various experimental 'omics' approaches, recent application of the integrated 'omics' for exploring metabolic and regulatory mechanisms in microbes, and advances in computational and statistical methodologies associated with integrated 'omics' analyses. Online databases and bioinformatic infrastructure available for integrated 'omics' analyses are also briefly discussed.},

For nutritional shifts between two preferred carbon sources of Bacillus subtilis, we combined statistical and model-based data analyses of dynamic transcript, protein, and metabolite abundances and promoter activities. Adaptation to malate was rapid and primarily controlled posttranscriptionally compared with the slow, mainly transcriptionally controlled adaptation to glucose that entailed nearly half of the known transcription regulation network. Interactions across multiple levels of regulation were involved in adaptive changes that could also be achieved by controlling single genes. Our analysis suggests that global trade-offs and evolutionary constraints provide incentives to favor complex control programs.},

Here, we describe the generation of a first version of the human ORFeome using a newly improved Gateway recombinational cloning approach. Using the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) resource as a starting point, we report the successful cloning of 8076 human ORFs, representing at least 7263 human genes, as mini-pools of PCR-amplified products. These were assembled into the human ORFeome version 1.1 (hORFeome v1.1) collection. After assessing the overall quality of this version, we describe the use of hORFeome v1.1 for heterologous protein expression in two different expression systems at proteome scale. The hORFeome v1.1 represents a central resource for the cloning of large sets of human ORFs in various settings for functional proteomics of many types, and will serve as the foundation for subsequent improved versions of the human ORFeome.},

abstract = {Physical interactions mediated by proteins are critical for most cellular functions and altogether form a complex macromolecular "interactome" network. Systematic mapping of protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-metabolite interactions at the scale of the whole proteome can advance understanding of interactome networks with applications ranging from single protein functional characterization to discoveries on local and global systems properties. Since the early efforts at mapping protein-protein interactome networks a decade ago, the field has progressed rapidly giving rise to a growing number of interactome maps produced using high-throughput implementations of either binary protein-protein interaction assays or co-complex protein association methods. Although high-throughput methods are often thought to necessarily produce lower quality information than low-throughput experiments, we have recently demonstrated that proteome-scale interactome datasets can be produced with equal or superior quality than that observed in literature-curated datasets derived from large numbers of small-scale experiments. In addition to performing all experimental steps thoroughly and including all necessary controls and quality standards, careful verification of all interacting pairs and validation tests using independent, orthogonal assays are crucial to ensure the release of interactome maps of the highest possible quality. This chapter describes a high-quality, high-throughput binary protein-protein interactome mapping pipeline that includes these features.},

abstract = {Anion exchanger 1 (AE1) is the plasma membrane Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchanger of erythrocytes. Carbonic anhydrases (CA) provide substrate for AE1 by catalyzing the reaction, H(2)O + CO(2) ↔ HCO(3)(-) + H(+). The physical complex of CAII with AE1 has been proposed to maximize anion exchange activity. To examine the effect of CAII catalysis on AE1 transport rate, we fused either CAII-wild type or catalytically inactive CAII-V143Y to the cytoplasmic COOH terminus of AE1 to form AE1.CAII and AE1.CAII-V143Y, respectively. When expressed in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, AE1.CAII had a similar Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange activity to AE1 alone, as assessed by the flux of H(+) equivalents (87 $\pm$ 4% vs. AE1) or rate of change of intracellular Cl(-) concentration (93 $\pm$ 4% vs. AE1), suggesting that CAII does not activate AE1. In contrast, AE1.CAII-V143Y displayed transport rates for H(+) equivalents and Cl(-) of 55 $\pm$ 2% and of 40 $\pm$ 2%, versus AE1. Fusion of CAII to AE1 therefore reduces anion transport activity, but this reduction is compensated for during Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange by the presence of catalytically active CAII. Overexpression of free CAII-V143Y acts in a dominant negative manner to reduce AE1-mediated HCO(3)(-) transport by displacement of endogenous CAII-wild type from its binding site on AE1. To examine whether AE1.CAII bound endogenous CAII, we coexpressed CAII-V143Y along with AE1 or AE1.CAII. The bicarbonate transport activity of AE1 was inhibited by CAII-V143Y, whereas the activity of AE1.CAII was unaffected by CAII-V143Y, suggesting impaired transport activity upon displacement of functional CAII from AE1 but not AE1.CAII. Taken together, these data suggest that association of functional CAII with AE1 increases Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange activity, consistent with the HCO(3)(-) transport metabolon model.},

The past few years have seen an exponential increase in papers describing characterization of intrinsically disordered proteins, both free and bound to targets. Although NMR spectroscopy remains the favored tool, a number of new biophysical techniques are proving exceptionally useful in defining the limits of the conformational ensembles. Advances have been made in prediction of the recognition elements in disordered proteins, in elucidating the kinetics and mechanism of the coupled folding and binding process, and in understanding the role of post-translational modifications in tuning the biological response. Here we review these and other recent advances that are providing new insights into the conformational propensities and interactions of intrinsically disordered proteins and are beginning to reveal general principles underlying their biological functions.},

abstract = {F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) technology has been widely used in biological and biomedical research and is a very powerful tool in elucidating protein interactions in many cellular processes. Ubiquitination and SUMOylation are multi-step cascade reactions, involving multiple enzymes and protein-protein interactions. Here we report the development of dissociation constant (K (d)) determination for protein-protein interaction and cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay in SUMOylation cascade using FRET technology. These developments are based on steady state and high efficiency of fluorescent energy transfer between CyPet and YPet fused with SUMO1 and Ubc9, respectively. The developments in theoretical and experimental procedures for protein interaction K (d) determination and cell-based HTS provide novel tools in affinity measurement and protein interaction inhibitor screening. The K (d) determined by FRET between SUMO1 and Ubc9 is compatible with those determined with other traditional approaches, such as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The FRET-based HTS is pioneer in cell-based HTS. Both K (d) determination and cell-based HTS, carried out in 384-well plate format, provide powerful tools for large-scale and high-throughput applications.},

abstract = {Dosage suppression is a genetic interaction in which overproduction of one gene rescues a mutant phenotype of another gene. Although dosage suppression is known to map functional connections among genes, the extent to which it might illuminate global cellular functions is unclear. Here we analyze a network of interactions linking dosage suppressors to 437 essential genes in yeast. For 424 genes, we curated interactions from the literature. Analyses revealed that many dosage suppression interactions occur between functionally related genes and that the majority do not overlap with other types of genetic or physical interactions. To confirm the generality of these network properties, we experimentally identified dosage suppressors for 29 genes from pooled populations of temperature-sensitive mutant cells transformed with a high-copy molecular-barcoded open reading frame library, MoBY-ORF 2.0. We classified 87% of the 1,640 total interactions into four general types of suppression mechanisms, which provided insight into their relative frequencies. This work suggests that integrating the results of dosage suppression studies with other interaction networks could generate insights into the functional wiring diagram of a cell.},

The involvement of many of these intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs) in intracellular signalling and regulatory processes as well as their central positioning (as interaction hubs) in recently mapped protein interaction networks is particularly intriguing. Here, we review the functional and structural properties of IUPs such as (i) their facilitated regulation via diverse post-translational modifications of specific amino acids (ii) scaffolding and recruitment of different binding partners in space and time via the "fly-casting" mechanism, through peptide motifs and by coupling folding with binding and (iii) conformational variability and adaptability. All of these properties allow these proteins to hold key positions in cellular organisation and regulation which in turn make them tractable as drug targets. In addition, we discuss how such properties, individually and in combination, facilitate combinatorial regulation and re-use of the same component in multiple biological processes.},

B 268, 1803-1810; Jeong, H., Tombor, B., Albert, R., Oltvai, Z. N. \{\&} Barabasi, A. L. (2000) Nature 407, 651-654] or degree correlation [Maslov, S. \{\&} Sneppen, K. (2002) Science 296, 910-913], and hence focused on single/two-body properties of these networks. Here, by analyzing the multibody structure of the network of protein-protein interactions, we discovered molecular modules that are densely connected within themselves but sparsely connected with the rest of the network. Comparison with experimental data and functional annotation of genes showed two types of modules: (i) protein complexes (splicing machinery, transcription factors, etc.) and (ii) dynamic functional units (signaling cascades, cell-cycle regulation, etc.). Discovered modules are highly statistically significant, as is evident from comparison with random graphs, and are robust to noise in the data. Our results provide strong support for the network modularity principle introduced by Hartwell et al. [Hartwell, L. H., Hopfield, J. J., Leibler, S. \{\&} Murray, A. W. (1999) Nature 402, C47-C52], suggesting that found modules constitute the "building blocks" of molecular networks.},

abstract = {A major challenge in the post-genome era will be determination of the functions of the encoded protein sequences. Since it is generally assumed that the function of a protein is closely linked to its three-dimensional structure, prediction or experimental determination of the library of protein structures is a matter of high priority. However, a large proportion of gene sequences appear to code not for folded, globular proteins, but for long stretches of amino acids that are likely to be either unfolded in solution or adopt non-globular structures of unknown conformation. Characterization of the conformational propensities and function of the non-globular protein sequences represents a major challenge. The high proportion of these sequences in the genomes of all organisms studied to date argues for important, as yet unknown functions, since there could be no other reason for their persistence throughout evolution. Clearly the assumption that a folded three-dimensional structure is necessary for function needs to be re-examined. Although the functions of many proteins are directly related to their three-dimensional structures, numerous proteins that lack intrinsic globular structure under physiological conditions have now been recognized. Such proteins are frequently involved in some of the most important regulatory functions in the cell, and the lack of intrinsic structure in many cases is relieved when the protein binds to its target molecule. The intrinsic lack of structure can confer functional advantages on a protein, including the ability to bind to several different targets. It also allows precise control over the thermodynamics of the binding process and provides a simple mechanism for inducibility by phosphorylation or through interaction with other components of the cellular machinery. Numerous examples of domains that are unstructured in solution but which become structured upon binding to the target have been noted in the areas of cell cycle control and both transcriptional and translational regulation, and unstructured domains are present in proteins that are targeted for rapid destruction. Since such proteins participate in critical cellular control mechanisms, it appears likely that their rapid turnover, aided by their unstructured nature in the unbound state, provides a level of control that allows rapid and accurate responses of the cell to changing environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Complex networks are studied across many fields of science. To uncover their structural design principles, we defined "network motifs," patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

abstract = {Biochemical adaptation of enzymes involves conservation of activity, stability and affinity across a wide range of intracellular and environmental conditions. Enzyme adaptation by alteration of primary structure is well known, but the roles of protein-protein interactions in enzyme adaptation are less well understood. Interspecific differences in thermal stability of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in porcelain crabs (genus Petrolisthes) are related to intrinsic differences among LDH molecules and by interactions with other stabilizing proteins. Here, we identified proteins that interact with LDH in porcelain crab claw muscle tissue using co-immunoprecipitation, and showed LDH exists in high molecular weight complexes using size exclusion chromatography and Western blot analyses. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were separated using 2D SDS PAGE and analyzed by LC/ESI using peptide MS/MS. Peptide MS/MS ions were compared to an EST database for Petrolisthes cinctipes to identify proteins. Identified proteins included cytoskeletal elements, glycolytic enzymes, a phosphagen kinase, and the respiratory protein hemocyanin. Our results support the hypothesis that LDH interacts with glycolytic enzymes in a metabolon structured by cytoskeletal elements that may also include the enzyme for transfer of the adenylate charge in glycolytically produced ATP. Those interactions may play specific roles in biochemical adaptation of glycolytic enzymes.},

abstract = {It has long been believed that cells organize their cytoplasm so as to efficiently channel metabolites between sequential enzymes. This metabolic channeling has the potential to yield higher metabolic fluxes as well as better regulatory control over metabolism. One mechanism for achieving such channeling is to ensure that sequential enzymes in a pathway are physically close to each other in the cell. We present evidence that indirect protein interactions between related enzymes represent a global mechanism for achieving metabolic channeling; the intuition being that protein interactions between enzymes and non-enzymatic mediator proteins are a powerful means of physically associating enzymes in a modular fashion. By analyzing the metabolic and protein-protein interactions networks of Escherichia coli, yeast and humans, we are able to show that all three species have many more indirect protein interactions linking enzymes that share metabolites than would be expected by chance. Moreover, these interactions are distributed non-randomly in the metabolic network. Our analyses in yeast and E. coli show that reactions possessing such interactions also show higher flux than do those lacking them. On the basis of these observations, we suggest that an important role of protein interactions with mediator proteins is to contribute to the spatial organization of the cell. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that these mediator proteins are also enriched with annotations related to signal transduction, a system where scaffolding proteins are known to limit cross-talk by controlling spatial localization.},

abstract = {Genes and proteins are organized on the basis of their particular mutual relations or according to their interactions in cellular and genetic networks. These include metabolic or signaling pathways and protein interaction, regulatory or co-expression networks. Integrating the information from the different types of networks may lead to the notion of a functional network and functional modules. To find these modules, we propose a new technique which is based on collective, multi-body correlations in a genetic network. We calculated the correlation strength of a group of genes (e.g. in the co-expression network) which were identified as members of a module in a different network (e.g. in the protein interaction network) and estimated the probability that this correlation strength was found by chance. Groups of genes with a significant correlation strength in different networks have a high probability that they perform the same function. Here, we propose evaluating the multi-body correlations by applying the superparamagnetic approach. We compare our method to the presently applied mean Pearson correlations and show that our method is more sensitive in revealing functional relationships.},

To address topological properties of these two networks, we quantified correlations between connectivities of interacting nodes and compared them to a null model of a network, in which all links were randomly rewired. We found that for both interaction and regulatory networks, links between highly connected proteins are systematically suppressed, whereas those between a highly connected and low-connected pairs of proteins are favored. This effect decreases the likelihood of cross talk between different functional modules of the cell and increases the overall robustness of a network by localizing effects of deleterious perturbations.},

However, it is widely recognized that allosteric effect does play an important role in biomolecular recognition and association. In this article, we describe a new quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)-based strategy to capture the structural and nonbonding information relating to not only the direct noncovalent interactions between protein binding partners, but also the indirect allosteric effect associated with binding. This method is then employed to quantitatively model and predict the protein-protein binding affinities compiled in a recently published benchmark consisting of 144 functionally diverse protein complexes with their structures available in both bound and unbound states (Kastritis et al. Protein Sci 20:482-491, 2011). With incorporating genetic algorithm and partial least squares regression (GA-PLS) into this method, a significant linear relationship between structural information descriptors and experimentally measured affinities is readily emerged and, on this basis, detailed discussions of physicochemical properties and structural implications underlying protein binding process, as well as the contribution of allosteric effect to the binding are addressed. We also give an empirical estimation of the prediction limit r (pred) (2)  = 0.80 for structure-based method used to determine protein-protein binding affinity.},

The corresponding Primary Performance Parameters calculated from these plots are presented and compared, It is expected that the use of this calibration method may help standardize flow cytometric measurements and will provide instrument-independent performance parameters to monitor quality control of instruments and reagents.

The physical principle is shortly discussed followed by a discussion of the experimental details to be considered when using this technology for biomolecular interaction analysis. Based on recent publications it is demonstrated that the technology has widespread applications in many fields of the drug discovery process. Protein/protein interactions can be monitored in real time when working with biopharmaceuticals as well as protein/small analyte interactions during hit finding, secondary screening, lead optimization and lead selection. Equilibrium binding constants, kinetic rate constants and thermodynamic parameters are obtained from such study that helps to understand the mechanism of the binding reactions.

abstract = {The set of regulatory interactions between genes, mediated by transcription factors, forms a species' transcriptional regulatory network (TRN). By comparing this network with measured gene expression data, one can identify functional properties of the TRN and gain general insight into transcriptional control. We define the subnet of a node as the subgraph consisting of all nodes topologically downstream of the node, including itself. Using a large set of microarray expression data of the bacterium Escherichia coli, we find that the gene expression in different subnets exhibits a structured pattern in response to environmental changes and genotypic mutation. Subnets with fewer changes in their expression pattern have a higher fraction of feed-forward loop motifs and a lower fraction of small RNA targets within them. Our study implies that the TRN consists of several scales of regulatory organization: (1) subnets with more varying gene expression controlled by both transcription factors and post-transcriptional RNA regulation and (2) subnets with less varying gene expression having more feed-forward loops and less post-transcriptional RNA regulation.},

abstract = {Many disease-associated variants identified by genome-wide association (GWA) studies are expected to regulate gene expression. Allele-specific expression (ASE) quantifies transcription from both haplotypes using individuals heterozygous at tested SNPs. We performed deep human transcriptome-wide resequencing (RNA-seq) for ASE analysis and expression quantitative trait locus discovery. We resequenced double poly(A)-selected RNA from primary CD4(+) T cells (n = 4 individuals, both activated and untreated conditions) and developed tools for paired-end RNA-seq alignment and ASE analysis. We generated an average of 20 million uniquely mapping 45 base reads per sample. We obtained sufficient read depth to test 1371 unique transcripts for ASE. Multiple biases inflate the false discovery rate which we estimate to be approximately 50% for random SNPs. However, after controlling for these biases and considering the subset of SNPs that pass HapMap QC, 4.6% of heterozygous SNP-sample pairs show evidence of imbalance (P < 0.001). We validated four findings by both bacterial cloning and Sanger sequencing assays. We also found convincing evidence for allelic imbalance at multiple reporter exonic SNPs in CD6 for two samples heterozygous at the multiple sclerosis-associated variant rs17824933, linking GWA findings with variation in gene expression. Finally, we show in CD4(+) T cells from a further individual that high-throughput sequencing of genomic DNA and RNA-seq following enrichment for targeted gene sequences by sequence capture methods offers an unbiased means to increase the read depth for transcripts of interest, and therefore a method to investigate the regulatory role of many disease-associated genetic variants.},

Here, we investigate the relationships between two distinct types of interaction networks: the metabolic pathway map and the protein-protein interaction network (PIN). It has long been established that successive enzymatic steps are often catalyzed by physically interacting proteins forming permanent or transient multi-enzymes complexes. Inspecting high-throughput PIN data, it was shown recently that, indeed, enzymes involved in successive reactions are generally more likely to interact than other protein pairs. In our study, we expanded this line of research to include comparisons of the underlying respective network topologies as well as to investigate whether the spatial organization of enzyme interactions correlates with metabolic efficiency.},

abstract = {We have used the public sequencing and annotation of the mouse genome to delimit the previously resolved type 1 diabetes (T1D) insulin-dependent diabetes (Idd)18 interval to a region on chromosome 3 that includes the immunologically relevant candidate gene, Vav3. To test the candidacy of Vav3, we developed a novel congenic strain that enabled the resolution of Idd18 to a 604-kb interval, designated Idd18.1, which contains only two annotated genes: the complete sequence of Vav3 and the last exon of the gene encoding NETRIN G1, Ntng1. Targeted sequencing of Idd18.1 in the NOD mouse strain revealed that allelic variation between NOD and C57BL/6J (B6) occurs in noncoding regions with 138 single nucleotide polymorphisms concentrated in the introns between exons 20 and 27 and immediately after the 3' untranslated region. We observed differential expression of VAV3 RNA transcripts in thymocytes when comparing congenic mouse strains with B6 or NOD alleles at Idd18.1. The T1D protection associated with B6 alleles of Idd18.1/Vav3 requires the presence of B6 protective alleles at Idd3, which are correlated with increased IL-2 production and regulatory T cell function. In the absence of B6 protective alleles at Idd3, we detected a second T1D protective B6 locus, Idd18.3, which is closely linked to, but distinct from, Idd18.1. Therefore, genetic mapping, sequencing, and gene expression evidence indicate that alteration of VAV3 expression is an etiological factor in the development of autoimmune beta-cell destruction in NOD mice. This study also demonstrates that a congenic strain mapping approach can isolate closely linked susceptibility genes.},

abstract = {Although the interleukin-2 (IL-2)/IL-2R signaling pathway has been the focus of numerous studies, certain aspects of its molecular regulation are not well characterized, especially in non-T cells, and a more complete understanding of the pathway is necessary to discern the functional basis of the genetic association between the IL-2-IL-21 and IL-2RA/CD25 gene regions and T1D in humans. Genetic variation in these regions may promote T1D susceptibility by influencing transcription and/or splicing and, hence, IL-2 and IL-2RA/CD25 expression at the protein level in different immune cell subsets; thus, there is a need to establish links between the genetic variation and immune cell phenotypes and functions in humans, which can be further investigated and validated in mouse models. The detection and characterization of genetically determined immunophenotypes should aid in elucidating disease mechanisms and may enable future monitoring of disease initiation and progression in prediabetic subjects and of responses to therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {Myosin VI has been implicated in many cellular processes including endocytosis, secretion, membrane ruffling and cell motility. We carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified TRAF6-binding protein (T6BP) and nuclear dot protein 52 (NDP52) as myosin VI binding partners. Myosin VI interaction with T6BP and NDP52 was confirmed in vitro and in vivo and the binding sites on each protein were accurately mapped. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy showed that T6BP, NDP52 and myosin VI are present at the trans side of the Golgi complex, and on vesicles in the perinuclear region. Although the SKICH domain in T6BP and NDP52 does not mediate recruitment into membrane ruffles, loss of T6BP and NDP52 in RNAi knockdown cells results in reduced membrane ruffling activity and increased stress fibre and focal adhesion formation. Furthermore, we observed in these knockdown cells an upregulation of constitutive secretion of alkaline phosphatase, implying that both proteins act as negative regulators of secretory traffic at the Golgi complex. T6BP was also found to inhibit NF-kappaB activation, implicating it in the regulation of TRAF6-mediated cytokine signalling. Thus myosin VI-T6BP interactions may link membrane trafficking pathways with cell adhesion and cytokine-dependent cell signalling.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interaction networks are typically built with interactions collated from many experiments. These networks are thus composite and show all interactions that are currently known to occur in a cell. However, these representations are static and ignore the constant changes in protein-protein interactions. Here we present software for the generation and analysis of dynamic, four-dimensional (4-D) protein interaction networks. In this, time-course-derived abundance data are mapped onto three-dimensional networks to generate network movies. These networks can be navigated, manipulated and queried in real time. Two types of dynamic networks can be generated: a 4-D network that maps expression data onto protein nodes and one that employs 'real-time rendering' by which protein nodes and their interactions appear and disappear in association with temporal changes in expression data. We illustrate the utility of this software by the analysis of singlish interface date hub interactions during the yeast cell cycle. In this, we show that proteins MLC1 and YPT52 show strict temporal control of when their interaction partners are expressed. Since these proteins have one and two interaction interfaces, respectively, it suggests that temporal control of gene expression may be used to limit competition at the interaction interfaces of some hub proteins. The software and movies of the 4-D networks are available at http://www.systemsbiology.org.au/downloads\_geomi.html.},

Studies in vitro have provided little evidence of anticipated protein-protein interactions that would enable substrate channeling and regulation of the metabolic flux. We applied fluorescence microscopy to HeLa cells and discovered that all six enzymes colocalize to form clusters in the cellular cytoplasm. The association and dissociation of these enzyme clusters can be regulated dynamically, by either changing the purine levels of or adding exogenous agents to the culture media. Collectively, the data provide strong evidence for the formation of a multi-enzyme complex, the "purinosome," to carry out de novo purine biosynthesis in cells.},

abstract = {Many essential cellular processes such as signal transduction, transport, cellular motion and most regulatory mechanisms are mediated by protein-protein interactions. In recent years, new experimental techniques have been developed to discover the protein-protein interaction networks of several organisms. However, the accuracy and coverage of these techniques have proven to be limited, and computational approaches remain essential both to assist in the design and validation of experimental studies and for the prediction of interaction partners and detailed structures of protein complexes. Here, we provide a critical overview of existing structure-independent and structure-based computational methods. Although these techniques have significantly advanced in the past few years, we find that most of them are still in their infancy. We also provide an overview of experimental techniques for the detection of protein-protein interactions. Although the developments are promising, false positive and false negative results are common, and reliable detection is possible only by taking a consensus of different experimental approaches. The shortcomings of experimental techniques affect both the further development and the fair evaluation of computational prediction methods. For an adequate comparative evaluation of prediction and high-throughput experimental methods, an appropriately large benchmark set of biophysically characterized protein complexes would be needed, but is sorely lacking.},

Our work suggests that network motifs are not optimised to perform a single dynamical task, but that some motifs are recurrent because, by a change of rules, they possess a broad range of functionality.},

abstract = {Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe malaria pathogen and has developed resistance to existing drugs making it indispensable to discover new drugs. In order to predict drug targets in silico, a useful model for the metabolism is needed. However, automatically reconstructed network models typically cover more non-confirmed enzymes than confirmed enzymes of known gene products. Furthermore, it needs to be considered that the parasite takes advantage of the metabolism of the host. We compared several reconstructed network models and aimed to find the best suitable reconstruction for detecting drug targets in silico. We computationally reconstructed the metabolism based on automatically inferred enzymes and compared this with a reconstructed model that was based only on enzymes whose coding genes are known. Additionally, we tested if integrating enzymes of the host cell is beneficial for such an analysis. We employed several well established criteria for defining essential enzymes including chokepoints, betweenness centrality (or load-points), connectivity and the diameter of the networks. Comparing the modeling results with a comprehensive list of known drug targets for P. falciparum, showed that we had the best discovery success with a network model consisting only of enzymes from the parasite alone which coding genes were known.},

abstract = {Several proteomic studies in the last decade revealed that many proteins are either completely disordered or possess long structurally flexible regions. Many such regions were shown to be of functional importance, often allowing a protein to interact with a large number of diverse partners. Parallel to these findings, during the last five years structural bioinformatics has produced an explosion of results regarding protein-protein interactions and their importance for cell signaling. We studied the occurrence of relatively short (10-70 residues), loosely structured protein regions within longer, largely disordered sequences that were characterized as bound to larger proteins. We call these regions molecular recognition features (MoRFs, also known as molecular recognition elements, MoREs). Interestingly, upon binding to their partner(s), MoRFs undergo disorder-to-order transitions. Thus, in our interpretation, MoRFs represent a class of disordered region that exhibits molecular recognition and binding functions. This work extends previous research showing the importance of flexibility and disorder for molecular recognition. We describe the development of a database of MoRFs derived from the RCSB Protein Data Bank and present preliminary results of bioinformatics analyses of these sequences. Based on the structure adopted upon binding, at least three basic types of MoRFs are found: alpha-MoRFs, beta-MoRFs, and iota-MoRFs, which form alpha-helices, beta-strands, and irregular secondary structure when bound, respectively. Our data suggest that functionally significant residual structure can exist in MoRF regions prior to the actual binding event. The contribution of intrinsic protein disorder to the nature and function of MoRFs has also been addressed. The results of this study will advance the understanding of protein-protein interactions and help towards the future development of useful protein-protein binding site predictors.},

The set of elementary modes for this system involves conventional glycolysis, a futile cycle, all the modes of PPP function described in biochemistry textbooks, and additional modes that are a priori equally entitled to pathway status. Applications include maximizing product yield in amino acid and antibiotic synthesis, reconstruction and consistency checks of metabolism from genome data, analysis of enzyme deficiencies, and drug target identification in metabolic networks.},

abstract = {KIRs (killer Ig-like receptors) expressed on natural killer (NK) cells are an important component of innate (and adaptive) immunity. They are either activatory or inhibitory, and certain KIRs are known to interact with specific motifs of HLA Class I molecules, which is very crucial in determining whether a cell is targeted to lysis or otherwise. Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a slowly progressive form of autoimmune diabetes, with an adult onset (>30 years). Because autoantibodies and autoimmunity involved are involved in the etiology of LADA, KIRs might play an important role in conferring susceptibility to or protection against the disease. The purpose of this study was to identify killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes, which are associated with susceptibility to and protection against type 1 diabetes in Latvian and Asian Indian patients with LADA. KIR and HLA-C ligand genotyping was performed using PCR-SSP in LADA patients from Latvia (n= 45) with age- and sex-matched controls (n= 92) and from India (n= 86) with controls (n= 98). Results showed that in Latvian patients with LADA, KIRs 2DL1, 2DS2, and 2DS4 were associated with susceptibility and KIR 2DS5 with protection. In Asian Indian LADA patients, KIRs 2DL5 and 3DL1 were associated with susceptibility and KIRs 2DS1 and 2DS3 with protection. Stratification analyses for KIRs that bind to HLA-C1 and C2 were performed. We concluded that KIRs are important in conferring susceptibility (or protection) to adult patients with LADA in both our study populations. However the KIR genes (and their HLA-C ligands) conferring susceptibility or protection in these two populations differ, showing a role of ethnicity in disease susceptibility.},

abstract = {The method of Hidden Markov Models is used to allow for unequal and unknown evolutionary rates at different sites in molecular sequences. Rates of evolution at different sites are assumed to be drawn from a set of possible rates, with a finite number of possibilities. The overall likelihood of phylogeny is calculated as a sum of terms, each term being the probability of the data given a particular assignment of rates to sites, times the prior probability of that particular combination of rates. The probabilities of different rate combinations are specified by a stationary Markov chain that assigns rate categories to sites. While there will be a very large number of possible ways of assigning rates to sites, a simple recursive algorithm allows the contributions to the likelihood from all possible combinations of rates to be summed, in a time proportional to the number of different rates at a single site. Thus with three rates, the effort involved is no greater than three times that for a single rate. This "Hidden Markov Model" method allows for rates to differ between sites and for correlations between the rates of neighboring sites. By summing over all possibilities it does not require us to know the rates at individual sites. However, it does not allow for correlation of rates at nonadjacent sites, nor does it allow for a continuous distribution of rates over sites. It is shown how to use the Newton-Raphson method to estimate branch lengths of a phylogeny and to infer from a phylogeny what assignment of rates to sites has the largest posterior probability. An example is given using beta-hemoglobin DNA sequences in eight mammal species; the regions of high and low evolutionary rates are inferred and also the average length of patches of similar rates.},

abstract = {Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium leprae. Susceptibility to leprosy is influenced by both genetic and non-genetic factors and the disease is known to cluster in families. One measure of genetic effect is the relative recurrence risk ratio, lambdaR. Estimates of this parameter can be inflated if environmental risk factors which also cluster in families, such as household contact, are not properly accounted for. We present the results of fitting a cross ratio model that allows estimation of the odds ratio of disease conditional on disease or no disease in a given relative, given measured covariates. From this model we can predict fitted values for lambdaR that represent the familial risk not accounted for by other covariates including observed household contact. If all covariates could be measured, this would be the 'genetic relative risk ratio'. We find lambdaR > 1 for all relative pairs except grandparent-grandchild, and lambdaR > 2 for siblings. Though not in itself evidence for a strong genetic susceptibility to leprosy, this result is consistent with much other evidence which suggests susceptibility to leprosy is under the control of many factors, the strongest of which may be non-genetic, with host genetics playing a small but significant role.},

To date, tools for the aggregate analysis of these datasets across multiple specimens grouped by different categorical variables, such as demographic information, have not been optimized. Often, the exploration of such datasets is accomplished by visualization of patterns with pie charts or bar charts, without easy access to statistical comparisons of measurements that comprise multiple components. Here we report on algorithms and a graphical interface we developed for these purposes. In particular, we discuss thresholding necessary for accurate representation of data in pie charts, the implications for display and comparison of normalized versus unnormalized data, and the effects of averaging when samples with significant background noise are present. Finally, we define a statistic for the nonparametric comparison of complex distributions to test for difference between groups of samples based on multi-component measurements. While originally developed to support the analysis of T cell functional profiles, these techniques are amenable to a broad range of datatypes.},

abstract = {Recent large-scale analyses of mainly full-length cDNA libraries generated from a variety of mouse tissues indicated that almost half of all representative cloned sequences did not contain an apparent protein-coding sequence, and were putatively derived from non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes. However, many of these clones were singletons and the majority were unspliced, raising the possibility that they may be derived from genomic DNA or unprocessed pre-mRNA contamination during library construction, or alternatively represent nonspecific "transcriptional noise." Here we show, using reverse transcriptase-dependent PCR, microarray, and Northern blot analyses, that many of these clones were derived from genuine transcripts of unknown function whose expression appears to be regulated. The ncRNA transcripts have larger exons and fewer introns than protein-coding transcripts. Analysis of the genomic landscape around these sequences indicates that some cDNA clones were produced not from terminal poly(A) tracts but internal priming sites within longer transcripts, only a minority of which is encompassed by known genes. A significant proportion of these transcripts exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns, as well as dynamic changes in their expression in macrophages following lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Taken together, the data provide strong support for the conclusion that ncRNAs are an important, regulated component of the mammalian transcriptome.},

We revisit a recent application of FC-HCS to the problem of cellular signature definition for acute graft-versus-host-disease. Our focus is on automation of the data processing steps using recent advances in statistical methodology. We demonstrate that effective results, on par with those obtained via manual processing, can be achieved using our automatic techniques. Such automation of FC-HCS has the potential to drastically improve diagnosis and biomarker identification.},

abstract = {Motivation: Many bioinformatics data resources not only hold data in the form of sequences, but also as annotation. In the majority of cases, annotation is written as scientific natural language: this is suitable for humans, but not particularly useful for machine processing. Ontologies offer a mechanism by which knowledge can be represented in a form capable of such processing. In this paper we investigate the use of ontological annotation to measure the similarities in knowledge content or 'semantic similarity' between entries in a data resource. These allow a bioinformatician to perform a similarity measure over annotation in an analogous manner to those performed over sequences. A measure of semantic similarity for the knowledge component of bioinformatics resources should afford a biologist a new tool in their repetoire of analyses.Results: We present the results from experiments that investigate the validity of using semantic similarity by comparison with sequence similarity. We show a simple extension that enables a semantic search of the knowledge held within sequence databases.},

Where is the remaining heritability? We estimated the proportion of variance for human height explained by 294,831 SNPs genotyped on 3,925 unrelated individuals using a linear model analysis, and validated the estimation method with simulations based on the observed genotype data. We show that 45% of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date.},

An increase in activating KIR- human leucocyte antigen ligand pairs has been associated with an additional risk to develop type 1 diabetes (T1D). T1D families [n = 184 (552 individuals); n = 176 (528 subjects)], unrelated T1D patients (n = 380; n = 394) and healthy controls (n = 315; n = 401) from Germany and Belgium, respectively, were genotyped for the rs2756923 polymorphism within the KIR gene cluster haplotype B in exon 8 of the KIR2DL2 gene. We observed in both Germans and Belgians an overtransmission of the allele 'G' of the KIR2DL2-rs2756923 polymorphism (64.2% vs 35.8%, P = 3 x 10(-4) and 60.0% vs 40.0%, P = 0.02, respectively). In addition, this allele was more frequent in German patients than in healthy controls (78.4% vs 21.6%, P = 1 x 10(-3)). Preliminary results from a cytotoxicity assay suggest that inhibition of NK-cell cytotoxicity may be impaired in individuals carrying the rs2756923 G allele. These data suggest a potential role of the KIR2DL2-rs2756923 polymorphism in T1D in Germans and Belgians.},

Here, we report on changes that have occurred since our 2010 NAR paper (release 24.0). Over the last 2 years, we have generated 1840 new families and increased coverage of the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) to nearly 80%. Notably, we have taken the step of opening up the annotation of our families to the Wikipedia community, by linking Pfam families to relevant Wikipedia pages and encouraging the Pfam and Wikipedia communities to improve and expand those pages. We continue to improve the Pfam website and add new visualizations, such as the 'sunburst' representation of taxonomic distribution of families. In this work we additionally address two topics that will be of particular interest to the Pfam community. First, we explain the definition and use of family-specific, manually curated gathering thresholds. Second, we discuss some of the features of domains of unknown function (also known as DUFs), which constitute a rapidly growing class of families within Pfam.},

abstract = {In many resource-poor areas, the HIV/AIDS epidemic coexists with epidemics of two much older diseases, malaria and tuberculosis, and the three diseases together kill approximately six million people per year. Although HIV/AIDS is treatable, but not curable, many if not most cases of malaria and tuberculosis (TB) can be cured if diagnosed correctly and promptly. The diagnosis of both malaria and TB is cell-based, typically made by microscopy of stained smears of blood (malaria) and sputum (TB). Cytometry has been shown to be effective for diagnosis of both conditions; however, conventional cytometers have been too complex and costly to be widely applied. It is likely that a newly developed small, simple, robust, inexpensive, energy-efficient low-resolution fluorescence image cytometer, employing a light-emitting diode for excitation and a megapixel digital camera chip for detection, could be used in resource-poor areas for malaria and TB diagnosis and for rapid (24-48 h) determination of antimicrobial susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.},

abstract = {The capability of flow cytometry to offer rapid quantification of multidimensional characteristics for millions of cells has made this technology indispensable for health research, medical diagnosis, and treatment. However, the lack of statistical and bioinformatics tools to parallel recent high-throughput technological advancements has hindered this technology from reaching its full potential. We propose a flexible statistical model-based clustering approach for identifying cell populations in flow cytometry data based on t-mixture models with a Box-Cox transformation. This approach generalizes the popular Gaussian mixture models to account for outliers and allow for nonelliptical clusters. We describe an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to simultaneously handle parameter estimation and transformation selection. Using two publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology provides enough flexibility and robustness to mimic manual gating results performed by an expert researcher. In addition, we present results from a simulation study, which show that this new clustering framework gives better results in terms of robustness to model misspecification and estimation of the number of clusters, compared to the popular mixture models. The proposed clustering methodology is well adapted to automated analysis of flow cytometry data. It tends to give more reproducible results, and helps reduce the significant subjectivity and human time cost encountered in manual gating analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical flow cytometry typically involves the sequential interpretation of two-dimensional histograms, usually culled from six or more cellular characteristics, following initial selection (gating) of cell populations based on a different subset of these characteristics. We examined the feasibility of instead treating gated n-parameter clinical flow cytometry data as objects embedded in n-dimensional space using principles of information geometry via a recently described method known as Fisher Information Non-parametric Embedding (FINE). METHODS: After initial selection of relevant cell populations through an iterative gating strategy, we converted four color (six-parameter) clinical flow cytometry datasets into six-dimensional probability density functions, and calculated differences among these distributions using the Kullback-Leibler divergence (a measurement of relative distributional entropy shown to be an appropriate approximation of Fisher information distance in certain types of statistical manifolds). Neighborhood maps based on Kullback-Leibler divergences were projected onto two dimensional displays for comparison. RESULTS: These methods resulted in the effective unsupervised clustering of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia from cases of expansion of physiologic B-cell precursors (hematogones) within a set of 54 patient samples. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of flow cytometry datasets as objects embedded in high-dimensional space (as opposed to sequential two-dimensional analyses) harbors the potential for use as a decision-support tool in clinical practice or as a means for context-based archiving and searching of clinical flow cytometry data based on high-dimensional distribution patterns contained within stored list mode data. Additional studies will be needed to further test the effectiveness of this approach in clinical practice. (c) 2008 Clinical Cytometry Society.},

abstract = {The Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), and the Protein Information Resource (PIR) form the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) consortium. Its main goal is to provide the scientific community with a central resource for protein sequences and functional information. The UniProt consortium maintains the UniProt KnowledgeBase (UniProtKB) and several supplementary databases including the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef) and the UniProt Archive (UniParc). (1) UniProtKB is a comprehensive protein sequence knowledgebase that consists of two sections: UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, which contains manually annotated entries, and UniProtKB/TrEMBL, which contains computer-annotated entries. UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries contain information curated by biologists and provide users with cross-links to about 100 external databases and with access to additional information or tools. (2) The UniRef databases (UniRef100, UniRef90, and UniRef50) define clusters of protein sequences that share 100, 90, or 50% identity. (3) The UniParc database stores and maps all publicly available protein sequence data, including obsolete data excluded from UniProtKB. The UniProt databases can be accessed online (http://www.uniprot.org/) or downloaded in several formats (ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub). New releases are published every 2 weeks. The purpose of this chapter is to present a guided tour of a UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry, paying particular attention to the specificities of plant protein annotation. We will also present some of the tools and databases that are linked to each entry.},

abstract = {The heterogeneity in the healthy human immune system, and the immunological changes that portend various diseases, have been only partially described. Their comprehensive elucidation has been termed the 'Human Immunology Project'. The accurate measurement of variations in the human immune system requires precise and standardized assays to distinguish true biological changes from technical artefacts. Thus, to be successful, the Human Immunology Project will require standardized assays for immunophenotyping humans in health and disease. A major tool in this effort is flow cytometry, which remains highly variable with regard to sample handling, reagents, instrument setup and data analysis. In this Review, we outline the current state of standardization of flow cytometry assays and summarize the steps that are required to enable the Human Immunology Project.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Protein-protein interaction (PPI) databases have become a major resource for investigating biological networks and pathways in cells. A number of publicly available repositories for human PPIs are currently available. Each of these databases has their own unique features with a large variation in the type and depth of their annotations.

RESULTS:We analyzed the major publicly available primary databases that contain literature curated PPI information for human proteins. This included BIND, DIP, HPRD, IntAct, MINT, MIPS, PDZBase and Reactome databases. The number of binary non-redundant human PPIs ranged from 101 in PDZBase and 346 in MIPS to 11,367 in MINT and 36,617 in HPRD. The number of genes annotated with at least one interactor was 9,427 in HPRD, 4,975 in MINT, 4,614 in IntAct, 3,887 in BIND and <1,000 in the remaining databases. The number of literature citations for the PPIs included in the databases was 43,634 in HPRD, 11,480 in MINT, 10,331 in IntAct, 8,020 in BIND and <2,100 in the remaining databases.

CONCLUSION:Given the importance of PPIs, we suggest that submission of PPIs to repositories be made mandatory by scientific journals at the time of manuscript submission as this will minimize annotation errors, promote standardization and help keep the information up to date. We hope that our analysis will help guide biomedical scientists in selecting the most appropriate database for their needs especially in light of the dramatic differences in their content.},

Despite recent advances in measurement technology, methods for analyzing high-dimensional single-cell data are often subjective, labor intensive and require prior knowledge of the biological system. To objectively uncover cellular heterogeneity from single-cell measurements, we present a versatile computational approach, spanning-tree progression analysis of density-normalized events (SPADE). We applied SPADE to flow cytometry data of mouse bone marrow and to mass cytometry data of human bone marrow. In both cases, SPADE organized cells in a hierarchy of related phenotypes that partially recapitulated well-described patterns of hematopoiesis. We demonstrate that SPADE is robust to measurement noise and to the choice of cellular markers. SPADE facilitates the analysis of cellular heterogeneity, the identification of cell types and comparison of functional markers in response to perturbations.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Standard statistical techniques often assume that data are normally distributed, with constant variance not depending on the mean of the data. Data that violate these assumptions can often be brought in line with the assumptions by application of a transformation. Gene-expression microarray data have a complicated error structure, with a variance that changes with the mean in a non-linear fashion. Log transformations, which are often applied to microarray data, can inflate the variance of observations near background.

RESULTS:We introduce a transformation that stabilizes the variance of microarray data across the full range of expression. Simulation studies also suggest that this transformation approximately symmetrizes microarray data.},

We performed a phase 1 clinical trial to test the safety and immunologic effects of rapamycin/IL-2 combination therapy in type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients. Nine T1D subjects were treated with 2-4 mg/day rapamycin orally for 3 months and 4.5 × 10(6) IU IL-2 s.c. three times per week for 1 month. $\beta$-Cell function was monitored by measuring C-peptide. Immunologic changes were monitored using flow cytometry and serum analyses. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) increased within the first month of therapy, yet clinical and metabolic data demonstrated a transient worsening in all subjects. The increase in Tregs was transient, paralleling IL-2 treatment, whereas the response of Tregs to IL-2, as measured by STAT5 phosphorylation, increased and persisted after treatment. No differences were observed in effector T-cell subset frequencies, but an increase in natural killer cells and eosinophils occurred with IL-2 therapy. Rapamycin/IL-2 therapy, as given in this phase 1 study, resulted in transient $\beta$-cell dysfunction despite an increase in Tregs. Such results highlight the difficulties in translating therapies to the clinic and emphasize the importance of broadly interrogating the immune system to evaluate the effects of therapy.},

We identified 13 new celiac disease risk loci reaching genome-wide significance, bringing the number of known loci (including the HLA locus) to 40. We found multiple independent association signals at over one-third of these loci, a finding that is attributable to a combination of common, low-frequency and rare genetic variants. Compared to previously available data such as those from HapMap3, our dense genotyping in a large sample collection provided a higher resolution of the pattern of linkage disequilibrium and suggested localization of many signals to finer scale regions. In particular, 29 of the 54 fine-mapped signals seemed to be localized to single genes and, in some instances, to gene regulatory elements. Altogether, we define the complex genetic architecture of the risk regions of and refine the risk signals for celiac disease, providing the next step toward uncovering the causal mechanisms of the disease.},

abstract = {DNA microarray technology has developed rapidly in recent years and has become an essential tool, providing novel approaches to biomedical research. In this paper, we describe a self-designed ImmunoChip cDNA array for immunological research. With a comprehensive selection of genes of interest, we can focus on key signalling pathways and molecular mechanisms at relatively low cost compared to commercial platforms which are usually targeted at global screening of gene expression. To validate the efficiency of the ImmunoChip, we studied T helper cell polarization to functionally distinct subsets (Th1 and Th2). We also developed a tool for quality control of cDNA microarrays that assesses the technical quality of an ImmunoChip. The information produced with the quality control tool is shown to be valuable for extracting correct information from cDNA microarrays. Gene expression measurements with ImmunoChip are in agreement with the results obtained using oligonucleotide microarrays and with published quantitative RT-PCR data. The ImmunoChip provides reliable measurements and gives new insights into various aspects of human immune responses. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Previous studies have reported that the adoption of a single-platform flow cytometry cell counting method resulted in lower interlaboratory variation in absolute T cell counts as compared to predicate dual-platform flow cytometry methods which incorporate independent automated lymphocyte counts (Schnizlein-Bick et al., Clin Diagn Lab Immunol 2000;7:336-343; Reimann et al., Clin Diagn Lab Immunol 2000;7:34-4-351). In the present study, we asked whether use of a single-platform method could reduce variation in absolute cell counts across the laboratories in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) (n = 4), as suggested by the studies cited.Methods: Identical study samples were shipped overnight to the MACS laboratories either by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Division of AIDS Immunology Quality Assessment (NIAID-IQA) proficiency-testing program (n = 14), or by the Los Angeles site of the MACS (n = 10). For each sample, two tubes of blood were received; one was used for an automated complete blood count and differential, and the other for flow cytometry. The latter was performed using both our current dual-platform method (three-color CD45 gating and automated hematology) and the single-platform method (with TruCOUNT (R) beads to generate the absolute counts).Results: The median percent coefficients of variation (%CVs) for the dual-platform and single-platform methods were 6.6 and 9.9, respectively, for CD4 T cell counts, and 5.9 and 8.5, respectively, for CD8 T cell counts (n = 24). These differences were not statistically significant. The differences in absolute T-cell counts between the MACS sites and the median of all laboratories participating in the NIAID-IQA were smaller for the dual-platform than for single-platform absolute count method.Conclusion: In contrast to previous reports, we did not observe lower interlaboratory variation across the MACS sites for single-platform absolute lymphocyte subset counting relative to dual-platform methods. This result may be at least partly explained by the lower interlaboratory variation with the optimized dual-platform method in this study relative to the previous reports.

abstract = {SiZer is a powerful method for exploratory data analysis. In this article approximations to the distributions underlying the simultaneous statistical inference are investigated, and large improvements are made in the approximation using extreme value theory. This results in improved size, and also in an improved global inference version of SiZer. The main points are illustrated with real data and simulated examples.},

abstract = {Flow cytometry (FCM) has become an important analysis technology in health care and medical research, but the large volume of data produced by modern high-throughput experiments has presented significant new challenges for computational analysis tools. The development of an FCM software suite in Bioconductor represents one approach to overcome these challenges. In the spirit of the R programming language (Tree Star Inc., {\&}{\#}8220;FlowJo{\&}{\#}8221;), these tools are predominantly console-driven, allowing for programmatic access and rapid development of novel algorithms. Using this software requires a solid understanding of programming concepts and of the R language. However, some of these tools|in particular the statistical graphics and novel analytical methods|are also useful for nonprogrammers. To this end, we have developed an open source, extensible graphical user interface (GUI) iFlow, which sits on top of the Bioconductor backbone, enabling basic analyses by means of convenient graphical menus and wizards. We envision iFlow to be easily extensible in order to quickly integrate novel methodological developments.},

abstract = {Proteins perform most cellular functions in macromolecular complexes. The same protein often participates in different complexes to exhibit diverse functionality. Current ensemble approaches of identifying cellular protein interactions cannot reveal physiological permutations of these interactions. Here we describe a single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) assay that combines the principles of a conventional pull-down assay with single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and enables direct visualization of individual cellular protein complexes. SiMPull can reveal how many proteins and of which kinds are present in the in vivo complex, as we show using protein kinase A. We then demonstrate a wide applicability to various signalling proteins found in the cytosol, membrane and cellular organelles, and to endogenous protein complexes from animal tissue extracts. The pulled-down proteins are functional and are used, without further processing, for single-molecule biochemical studies. SiMPull should provide a rapid, sensitive and robust platform for analysing protein assemblies in biological pathways.},

abstract = {The IL-2/IL-2R signaling pathway has an important role in autoimmunity. Several genes identified in genome-wide association (GWA) studies encode proteins in the IL-2/IL-2R signaling cascade that are associated with autoimmune diseases. One of these, PTPN2, encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase that is highly expressed in T cells and regulates cytokine signaling. An intronic risk allele in PTPN2, rs1893217(C), correlated with decreased IL-2R signaling in CD4(+) T cells as measured by phosphorylation of STAT5 (phosphorylated STAT5 (pSTAT5)). We modeled an additive single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype, in which each copy of the risk allele conferred a decrease in IL-2R signaling (P=4.4 × 10(-8)). Decreased pSTAT5 impacted IL-2R$\beta$ chain signaling resulting in reduced FOXP3 expression in activated cells. This phenotype was not due to overt differences in expression of the IL-2R, molecules in the IL-2R signaling cascade or defects in STAT5. However, the rs1893217(C) risk variant did correlate with decreased PTPN2 expression in CD4(+)CD45RO T cells (P=0.0002). Thus, the PTPN2rs1893217(C) risk allele associated with reduced pSTAT5 in response to IL-2 and reduced PTPN2 expression. Together, these data suggest that decreased expression of PTPN2 may indirectly modulate IL-2 responsiveness. These findings, identified through genotype/phenotype relationships, may lead to identification of novel mechanisms underlying dysregulation of cytokine signaling in autoimmunity.},

abstract = {Members of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family, a large group of polymorphic receptors expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, recognize particular peptide-laden human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) class I molecules and have a pivotal role in innate immune responses. Allelic variation and extensive polymorphism within the three-domain KIR family (KIR3D, domains D0-D1-D2) affects pHLA binding specificity and is linked to the control of viral replication and the treatment outcome of certain haematological malignancies. Here we describe the structure of a human KIR3DL1 receptor bound to HLA-B*5701 complexed with a self-peptide. KIR3DL1 clamped around the carboxy-terminal end of the HLA-B*5701 antigen-binding cleft, resulting in two discontinuous footprints on the pHLA. First, the D0 domain, a distinguishing feature of the KIR3D family, extended towards $\beta$2-microglobulin and abutted a region of the HLA molecule with limited polymorphism, thereby acting as an 'innate HLA sensor' domain. Second, whereas the D2-HLA-B*5701 interface exhibited a high degree of complementarity, the D1-pHLA-B*5701 contacts were suboptimal and accommodated a degree of sequence variation both within the peptide and the polymorphic region of the HLA molecule. Although the two-domain KIR (KIR2D) and KIR3DL1 docked similarly onto HLA-C and HLA-B respectively, the corresponding D1-mediated interactions differed markedly, thereby providing insight into the specificity of KIR3DL1 for discrete HLA-A and HLA-B allotypes. Collectively, in association with extensive mutagenesis studies at the KIR3DL1-pHLA-B*5701 interface, we provide a framework for understanding the intricate interplay between peptide variability, KIR3D and HLA polymorphism in determining the specificity requirements of this essential innate interaction that is conserved across primate species.},

abstract = {Interactions of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands diversify natural killer cell responses to infection. By analyzing sequence variation in diverse human populations, we show that the KIR3DL1/S1 locus encodes two lineages of polymorphic inhibitory KIR3DL1 allotypes that recognize Bw4 epitopes of protein">HLA-A and HLA-B and one lineage of conserved activating KIR3DS1 allotypes, also implicated in Bw4 recognition. Balancing selection has maintained these three lineages for over 3 million years. Variation was selected at D1 and D2 domain residues that contact HLA class I and at two sites on D0, the domain that enhances the binding of KIR3D to HLA class I. HLA-B variants that gained Bw4 through interallelic microconversion are also products of selection. A worldwide comparison uncovers unusual KIR3DL1/S1 evolution in modern sub-Saharan Africans. Balancing selection is weak and confined to D0, KIR3DS1 is rare and KIR3DL1 allotypes with similar binding sites predominate. Natural killer cells express the dominant KIR3DL1 at a high frequency and with high surface density, providing strong responses to cells perturbed in Bw4 expression.},

In this review, we discuss how NK cells might use these dual roles, and suggest that future studies should focus on the impact of the anatomical localization of NK cells as well as the cytokine environment in which NK cells act in individual autoimmune diseases.},

A continuum of transitional cell states exists between these discrete stages. We combine the depth of single-cell mass cytometry and an algorithm developed to leverage this continuum by aligning single cells of a given lineage onto a unified trajectory that accurately predicts the developmental path de novo. Applied to human B cell lymphopoiesis, the algorithm (termed Wanderlust) constructed trajectories spanning from hematopoietic stem cells through to naive B cells. This trajectory revealed nascent fractions of B cell progenitors and aligned them with developmentally cued regulatory signaling including IL-7/STAT5 and cellular events such as immunoglobulin rearrangement, highlighting checkpoints across which regulatory signals are rewired paralleling changes in cellular state. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of human B lymphopoiesis, laying a foundation to apply this approach to other tissues and "corrupted" developmental processes including cancer.},

based on K-means clustering.


Unlike traditional K-means, flowMeans can identify concave cell populations by modelling a single population with multiple clusters.


flowMeans uses a change point detection algorithm to determine the number of subpopulations

The K-means clustering algorithm relies on users to define the number K of clusters to find.

We solved this problem by automatically choosing K based on a reasonable maximum.

number of nodes found individually in every eigenvector of the data makes mode-counting practical but results in overlapping clusters since some cell populations can be projected on more than one eigenvector and will be counted more than once.

Since FCM cell populations are not elliptical, flowMerge allows more than one elliptical component to model the same population. We developed a similar framework to extend the K-means algorithm by merging the clusters that belong to the same population. Using the spherical model of the K-means algorithm, our framework has a significantly lower runtime compared to more flexible but computationally expensive sta- tistical models (e.g., a skew/t-mixture model). Improvements in processing time are an important consideration in high- throughput data production environments. Savings in run- time also increase as the number of measured parameters increases, as is the trend in FCM technology.

abstract = {Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) regulate the activity of natural killer and T cells through interaction with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules on target cells. Like HLA class I genes that are characterised by extreme allelic polymorphism, KIR genes are diverse and vary in both gene content and allelic polymorphism. Population studies conducted over the last several years have showed that KIR gene frequencies (GF) and genotype content vary among different ethnic groups, indicating the extent of KIR diversity. Some studies have also shown the effect of the presence or absence of specific KIR genes in human disease. We have recently reported the distribution of KIR genes in populations from Java (Central Javanese and the Sundanese of West Java), East Timor (Timorese), Kalimantan provinces of Indonesian Borneo (Dayaks) and Irian Jaya (Western half of the island of New Guinea; Melanese). We here extend analysis of the KIR genes in populations from North Sulawesi (Minahasans), West Sumatra (Minangs) and Moluccas Islands. All 16 KIR genes were observed in all three populations. Variation in GF between populations was observed, except for the KIR2DL4, KIR3DL2, KIR3DL3 and KIR3DP1 genes, which were present in every individual tested. When comparing KIR GF between populations, both principal component analysis and phylogenetic tree analyses showed a close relationship between Minahasan and Moluccan populations that are clustered with Timorese in the same clade. The Minang tribe lies between the Javanese/Kalimantan and the Timorese/Minahasan/Moluccan clades, whereas Irianese show the greatest genetic distances from other Indonesian populations. The results correspond well with the history of migration in Indonesia and will contribute to the understanding of the genetic as well as the geographic history of the region.},

abstract = {Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system. In humans, NK cell activities are partly controlled by the diverse killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) gene family. The importance of NK cells in both immunity to infection and reproduction makes KIR strong candidates for genes undergoing dynamic evolution in the human genome. Using high-resolution allelic typing, we investigated the potential role of natural selection in the diversification of KIR in the Irish population. Higher diversity than expected is observed at several loci, consistent with a history of balancing selection acting to maintain several allelic variants at high frequency in the population. KIR diversity is enhanced further at the haplotype level with functional polymorphisms at KIR2DL4, KIR3DL1 and KIR2DS4 defining nine 'core' haplotypes. Analysis of these core haplotypes in combination with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I ligands revealed several nonrandom associations. In particular, the KIR:HLA association for the core haplotype defined by KIR3DL1(*)01502 was female specific and a likely consequence of negative selection acting against KIR3DL1(*)01502 on an HLA-C1/C1 background. Many of the associations between KIR and HLA in the Irish differ from those previously reported, which argues against universal selective pressures for specific KIR:HLA combinations in diverse human populations.},

abstract = {The extent to which variants in the protein-coding sequence of genes contribute to risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unknown. In this study, we addressed this issue by deep exon sequencing and large-scale genotyping of 25 biological candidate genes located within RA risk loci discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). First, we assessed the contribution of rare coding variants in the 25 genes to the risk of RA in a pooled sequencing study of 500 RA cases and 650 controls of European ancestry. We observed an accumulation of rare nonsynonymous variants exclusive to RA cases in IL2RA and IL2RB (burden test: p = 0.007 and p = 0.018, respectively). Next, we assessed the aggregate contribution of low-frequency and common coding variants to the risk of RA by dense genotyping of the 25 gene loci in 10,609 RA cases and 35,605 controls. We observed a strong enrichment of coding variants with a nominal signal of association with RA (p < 0.05) after adjusting for the best signal of association at the loci (p(enrichment) = 6.4 × 10(-4)). For one locus containing CD2, we found that a missense variant, rs699738 (c.798C>A [p.His266Gln]), and a noncoding variant, rs624988, reside on distinct haplotypes and independently contribute to the risk of RA (p = 4.6 × 10(-6)). Overall, our results indicate that variants (distributed across the allele-frequency spectrum) within the protein-coding portion of a subset of biological candidate genes identified by GWASs contribute to the risk of RA. Further, we have demonstrated that very large sample sizes will be required for comprehensively identifying the independent alleles contributing to the missing heritability of RA.},

abstract = {Technological advances make it possible to use high-throughput sequencing as a primary discovery tool of medical genetics, specifically for assaying rare variation. Still this approach faces the analytic challenge that the influence of very rare variants can only be evaluated effectively as a group. A further complication is that any given rare variant could have no effect, could increase risk, or could be protective. We propose here the C-alpha test statistic as a novel approach for testing for the presence of this mixture of effects across a set of rare variants. Unlike existing burden tests, C-alpha, by testing the variance rather than the mean, maintains consistent power when the target set contains both risk and protective variants. Through simulations and analysis of case/control data, we demonstrate good power relative to existing methods that assess the burden of rare variants in individuals.},

abstract = {A polymorphic region flanking the human insulin gene on the short arm of chromosome 11, the insulin-gene-linked DNA polymorphism, can be described as a locus with at least three classes of alleles: a common small "class 1" allele averaging 570 base pairs, a rare intermediate "class 2" allele of about 1320 base pairs, and a large "class 3" allele averaging 2470 base pairs in size. We have determined the genotype at this locus of 393 unrelated diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. Differences were observed in the genotypic and allelic frequencies between groups of different races. Asians [17 nondiabetic, 2 with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and 8 with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)] exhibited the least variation in the size of this locus and 98% of the alleles in this group were class 1. A group of American blacks (32 nondiabetic, 5 with IDDM, and 40 with NIDDM) exhibited considerable variation in the size of this locus, and about 22% of the individuals examined had a genotype that included a rare class 2 allele. In neither of these two racial groups were the genotypic or allelic frequencies different between the nondiabetic and diabetic segments of these groups. However, in a group of Caucasians (83 nondiabetic, 113 with IDDM, and 76 with NIDDM), there was a significantly higher frequency of class 1 alleles and genotypes containing two class 1 alleles in the diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {A major aim of HLA and disease association studies is to identify the causative HLA factor truly responsible for the association. This is usually difficult due to the pronounced linkage disequilibrium between most HLA determinants. The causative factor must show the strongest association compared to all other factors. Here we describe a simple analysis which can be used to identify which of two factors, say A and B, shows the strongest association. The basic data for the analysis are the entries of the two-by-four table giving the four phenotypic combinations of A and B in patients and controls, respectively. These data are analyzed in various two-by-two tables involving stratification of each of the two factors against the other. A stronger increase of factor A is established if A is significantly associated with the condition both in B-positives and in B-negatives, when this is not true for B in A-positives and A-negatives. Using simulation with control data, it is demonstrated how linkage disequilibrium may influence secondary associations. The analysis may also be used to investigate interaction between HLA factors, but linkage disequilibrium complicates the interpretation in such cases. The method is exemplified using various published data. Finally, some statistical recommendations are given. Thus, we advise that phenotype (marker) frequencies are generally used instead of gene (i.e. allele, or haplotype) frequencies. The importance of correcting p-values, the levels of significance, and the power of Fisher's exact test are discussed.},

abstract = {Recently, Wu and colleagues [1] proposed two novel statistics for genome-wide interaction analysis using case/control or case-only data. In computer simulations, their proposed case/control statistic outperformed competing approaches, including the fast-epistasis option in PLINK and logistic regression analysis under the correct model; however, reasons for its superior performance were not fully explored. Here we investigate the theoretical properties and performance of Wu et al.'s proposed statistics and explain why, in some circumstances, they outperform competing approaches. Unfortunately, we find minor errors in the formulae for their statistics, resulting in tests that have higher than nominal type 1 error. We also find minor errors in PLINK's fast-epistasis and case-only statistics, although theory and simulations suggest that these errors have only negligible effect on type 1 error. We propose adjusted versions of all four statistics that, both theoretically and in computer simulations, maintain correct type 1 error rates under the null hypothesis. We also investigate statistics based on correlation coefficients that maintain similar control of type 1 error. Although designed to test specifically for interaction, we show that some of these previously-proposed statistics can, in fact, be sensitive to main effects at one or both loci, particularly in the presence of linkage disequilibrium. We propose two new "joint effects" statistics that, provided the disease is rare, are sensitive only to genuine interaction effects. In computer simulations we find, in most situations considered, that highest power is achieved by analysis under the correct genetic model. Such an analysis is unachievable in practice, as we do not know this model. However, generally high power over a wide range of scenarios is exhibited by our joint effects and adjusted Wu statistics. We recommend use of these alternative or adjusted statistics and urge caution when using Wu et al.'s originally-proposed statistics, on account of the inflated error rate that can result.},

abstract = {This review paper describes a new technology, mass cytometry, that addresses applications typically run by flow cytometer analyzers, but extends the capability to highly multiparametric analysis. The detection technology is based on atomic mass spectrometry. It offers quantitation, specificity and dynamic range of mass spectrometry in a format that is familiar to flow cytometry practitioners. The mass cytometer does not require compensation, allowing the application of statistical techniques; this has been impossible given the constraints of fluorescence noise with traditional cytometry instruments. Instead of "colors" the mass cytometer "reads" the stable isotope tags attached to antibodies using metal-chelating labeling reagents. Because there are many available stable isotopes, and the mass spectrometer provides exquisite resolution between detection channels, many parameters can be measured as easily as one. For example, in a single tube the technique allows for the ready detection and characterization of the major cell subsets in blood or bone marrow. Here we describe mass cytometric immunophenotyping of human leukemia cell lines and leukemia patient samples, differential cell analysis of normal peripheral and umbilical cord blood; intracellular protein identification and metal-encoded bead arrays.},

abstract = {Flow cytometry is an essential tool for dissecting the functional complexity of hematopoiesis. We used single-cell "mass cytometry" to examine healthy human bone marrow, measuring 34 parameters simultaneously in single cells (binding of 31 antibodies, viability, DNA content, and relative cell size). The signaling behavior of cell subsets spanning a defined hematopoietic hierarchy was monitored with 18 simultaneous markers of functional signaling states perturbed by a set of ex vivo stimuli and inhibitors. The data set allowed for an algorithmically driven assembly of related cell types defined by surface antigen expression, providing a superimposable map of cell signaling responses in combination with drug inhibition. Visualized in this manner, the analysis revealed previously unappreciated instances of both precise signaling responses that were bounded within conventionally defined cell subsets and more continuous phosphorylation responses that crossed cell population boundaries in unexpected manners yet tracked closely with cellular phenotype. Collectively, such single-cell analyses provide system-wide views of immune signaling in healthy human hematopoiesis, against which drug action and disease can be compared for mechanistic studies and pharmacologic intervention.},

abstract = {A novel instrument for real time analysis of individual biological cells or other microparticles is described. The instrument is based on inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry and comprises a three-aperture plasma-vacuum interface, a dc quadrupole turning optics for decoupling ions from neutral components, an rf quadrupole ion guide discriminating against low-mass dominant plasma ions, a point-to-parallel focusing dc quadrupole doublet, an orthogonal acceleration reflectron analyzer, a discrete dynode fast ion detector, and an 8-bit 1 GHz digitizer. A high spectrum generation frequency of 76.8 kHz provides capability for collecting multiple spectra from each particle-induced transient ion cloud, typically of 200-300 micros duration. It is shown that the transients can be resolved and characterized individually at a peak frequency of 1100 particles per second. Design considerations and optimization data are presented. The figures of merit of the instrument are measured under standard inductively coupled plasma (ICP) operating conditions (<3% cerium oxide ratio). At mass resolution (full width at half-maximum) M/DeltaM > 900 for m/z = 159, the sensitivity with a standard sample introduction system of >1.4 x 10(8) ion counts per second per mg L(-1) of Tb and an abundance sensitivity of (6 x 10(-4))-(1.4 x 10(-3)) (trailing and leading masses, respectively) are shown. The mass range (m/z = 125-215) and abundance sensitivity are sufficient for elemental immunoassay with up to 60 distinct available elemental tags. When <15 elemental tags are used, a higher sensitivity mode at lower resolution (M/DeltaM > 500) can be used, which provides >2.4 x 10(8) cps per mg L(-1) of Tb, at (1.5 x 10(-3))-(5.0 x 10(-3)) abundance sensitivity. The real-time simultaneous detection of multiple isotopes from individual 1.8 microm polystyrene beads labeled with lanthanides is shown. A real time single cell 20 antigen expression assay of model cell lines and leukemia patient samples immuno-labeled with lanthanide-tagged antibodies is presented.},

abstract = {1. All members of 33 families in which two or more sibs have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) were HLA-typed. The results strongly support the hypothesis that, closely linked to the HLA region, there is a locus (S) for susceptibility to IDDM. We use Sd for alleles at this locus which confer susceptibility to disease, and Sa for all other alleles. 2. Published prevalence (recurrence) rates for relatives of an IDDM proband, which are essential for the analysis, are reviewed critically, and a new estimate of prevalence at age 30 in the general population is calculated from published data. 3. The analysis allows for greater risk (penetrance) of the genotype SdSd (two doses of Sd) than of SaSd (one dose of Sd) and for recombination between the HLA region and S. With either our own data on 26 affected sib pairs or a much larger sample assembled by pooling with published data, the maximum-likelihood estimate of the two-dose penetrance is 71%, of the one dose penetrance 6.5%. The hypothesis of differential penetrance according to gene dosage provides a significantly better explanation than either simple dominant or simple recessive inheritance. 4. Estimates of the recombination fraction between HLA and S are very sensitive to the proportion of affected sib pairs sharing neither HLA haplotype, which varies considerably among the samples pooled. With the pooled data the recombination fraction is estimated as 3%, but in view of the strong associations with particular HLA alleles seen in population data, this should probably be considered an upper limit.},

Family histories revealed an increased occurrence of IDDM among relatives in the affected families. The risk to siblings was estimated by age-corrected proband exclusion (3.3%) by age 20 and by the Li-Mantel segregation ratio estimator (6.0%). The comparison of these risk measures is discussed. The occurrence of IDDM among the parents is 2.6% and of NIDDM among the parents is 2.4%. A comparison of risk to relatives (parents, sibs, uncles, half-sibs) observed in the Pittsburgh Study to those of six other studies reveal essentially equivalent rates. There is no increased risk to siblings of a diabetic who had an early age of onset. There is an increased risk to siblings of a diabetic (10.5%) in families where at least one parent has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and also an increased risk to siblings of a diabetic (8.8%) when at least one parent has non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM). The average age of onset for second cases in a family is significantly older than age of onset in single case families.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE:To study the genetic contribution to the aetiology of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

DESIGN:Historical cohort study of twins, with information on diabetes being gathered by questionnaire, verification of the diagnosis by the subject's diabetologist or general practitioner, and clinical examination in available twins.

SETTING:Danish twin register and diabetic clinics and general practices throughout Denmark.

SUBJECTS:20,888 twin pairs born during 1953-82, included in a population based nationwide register.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Crude and cumulative concordance rates and heritability in monozygotic and dizygotic twins.

RESULTS:The crude probandwise concordance rate was 0.53 (95% confidence interval 0.33 to 0.73) for monozygotic twin pairs and 0.11 (0.05 to 0.21) for dizygotic twin pairs. When adjusted for age at onset of diabetes and age at last observation among unaffected twin partners the cumulative proband-wise risk from birth to age 35 was estimated as 0.70 (0.45 to 0.95) for monozygotic twins and 0.13 (0.05 to 0.20) for dizygotic twins. The correlations of liability for monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs were estimated as 0.96 (SE 0.09) and 0.58 (0.07), with a heritability estimate of 0.72 (0.21).

CONCLUSIONS:The risk of insulin dependent diabetes in monozygotic twins is higher than previously thought and for dizygotic twins is higher than in ordinary first degree relatives. Based on the findings of this study the genetic component to the disease seems more important than hitherto believed.},

abstract = {Flow cytometry is used increasingly in clinical research for cancer, immunology and vaccines. Technological advances in cytometry instrumentation are increasing the size and dimensionality of data sets, posing a challenge for traditional data management and analysis. Automated analysis methods, despite a general consensus of their importance to the future of the field, have been slow to gain widespread adoption. Here we present OpenCyto, a new BioConductor infrastructure and data analysis framework designed to lower the barrier of entry to automated flow data analysis algorithms by addressing key areas that we believe have held back wider adoption of automated approaches. OpenCyto supports end-to-end data analysis that is robust and reproducible while generating results that are easy to interpret. We have improved the existing, widely used core BioConductor flow cytometry infrastructure by allowing analysis to scale in a memory efficient manner to the large flow data sets that arise in clinical trials, and integrating domain-specific knowledge as part of the pipeline through the hierarchical relationships among cell populations. Pipelines are defined through a text-based csv file, limiting the need to write data-specific code, and are data agnostic to simplify repetitive analysis for core facilities. We demonstrate how to analyze two large cytometry data sets: an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) data set from a published HIV vaccine trial focused on detecting rare, antigen-specific T-cell populations, where we identify a new subset of CD8 T-cells with a vaccine-regimen specific response that could not be identified through manual analysis, and a CyTOF T-cell phenotyping data set where a large staining panel and many cell populations are a challenge for traditional analysis. The substantial improvements to the core BioConductor flow cytometry packages give OpenCyto the potential for wide adoption. It can rapidly leverage new developments in computational cytometry and facilitate reproducible analysis in a unified environment.},

abstract = {An up-to-date, comprehensive account of major issues in finite mixture modeling This volume provides an up-to-date account of the theory and applications of modeling via finite mixture distributions. With an emphasis on the applications of mixture models in both mainstream analysis and other areas such as unsupervised pattern recognition, speech recognition, and medical imaging, the book describes the formulations of the finite mixture approach, details its methodology, discusses aspects of its implementation, and illustrates its application in many common statistical contexts. Major issues discussed in this book include identifiability problems, actual fitting of finite mixtures through use of the EM algorithm, properties of the maximum likelihood estimators so obtained, assessment of the number of components to be used in the mixture, and the applicability of asymptotic theory in providing a basis for the solutions to some of these problems. The author also considers how the EM algorithm can be scaled to handle the fitting of mixture models to very large databases, as in data mining applications. This comprehensive, practical guide: * Provides more than 800 references-40% published since 1995 * Includes an appendix listing available mixture software * Links statistical literature with machine learning and pattern recognition literature * Contains more than 100 helpful graphs, charts, and tables Finite Mixture Models is an important resource for both applied and theoretical statisticians as well as for researchers in the many areas in which finite mixture models can be used to analyze data.},

abstract = {Accurate assignment of copy number at known copy number variant (CNV) loci is important for both increasing understanding of the structural evolution of genomes as well as for carrying out association studies of copy number with disease. As with calling SNP genotypes, the task can be framed as a clustering problem but for a number of reasons assigning copy number is much more challenging. CNV assays have lower signal-to-noise ratios than SNP assays, often display heavy tailed and asymmetric intensity distributions, contain outlying observations and may exhibit systematic technical differences among different cohorts. In addition, the number of copy-number classes at a CNV in the population may be unknown a priori. Due to these complications, automatic and robust assignment of copy number from array data remains a challenging problem. We have developed a copy number assignment algorithm, CNVCALL, for a targeted CNV array, such as that used by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium's recent CNV association study. We use a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model that robustly identifies both the number of different copy number classes at a specific locus as well as relative copy number for each individual in the sample. This approach is fully automated which is a critical requirement when analyzing large numbers of CNVs. We illustrate the methods performance using real data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium's CNV association study and using simulated data.},

Here, we investigated those variables significantly contributing to changes in the light scatter, autofluorescence, and bcl2 staining characteristics of peripheral blood (PB) leucocytes, after fixation with Fix {\&} Perm. Our major aim was to evaluate a new mathematical approach for automated harmonization of FCM data from datafiles corresponding to aliquots of a sample treated with cell-surface-only versus Fix {\&} Perm intracellular staining techniques. Overall, neither the anticoagulant used nor sample storage for <24 h showed significant impact on the light scatter and fluorescence properties of PB leucocytes; similarly, the duration of the fixation period (once >15 min were used) had a minimum impact on the FCM properties of PB leucocytes. Conversely, changes in cell/protein concentrations and the fixative/sample (vol/vol) ratio had a clear impact on the light scatter features of some populations of leucocytes. Accordingly, lower cell/protein concentrations were associated with lower scatter values, particularly for the neutrophils. Such changes could be partially corrected through the use of higher fixative to sample volume ratios. Despite the variable changes detected between aliquots of the same sample treated with cell surface-only versus intracellular staining procedures, the new mathematical approach here proposed and evaluated for automated harmonization of common parameters in both datafiles, could correct the FCM profiles of leucocytes derived from cells undergoing conventional fixation/permeabilization procedures, and made them indistinguishable from those corresponding to aliquots of the same sample treated with cell-surface-only staining techniques.},

abstract = {Immunophenotypic characterization of B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (B-CLPD) is becoming increasingly complex due to usage of progressively larger panels of reagents and a high number of World Health Organization (WHO) entities. Typically, data analysis is performed separately for each stained aliquot of a sample; subsequently, an expert interprets the overall immunophenotypic profile (IP) of neoplastic B-cells and assigns it to specific diagnostic categories. We constructed a principal component analysis (PCA)-based tool to guide immunophenotypic classification of B-CLPD. Three reference groups of immunophenotypic data files-B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLL; n = 10), mantle cell (MCL; n = 10) and follicular lymphomas (FL; n = 10)--were built. Subsequently, each of the 175 cases studied was evaluated and assigned to either one of the three reference groups or to none of them (other B-CLPD). Most cases (89%) were correctly assigned to their corresponding WHO diagnostic group with overall positive and negative predictive values of 89 and 96%, respectively. The efficiency of the PCA-based approach was particularly high among typical B-CLL, MCL and FL vs other B-CLPD cases. In summary, PCA-guided immunophenotypic classification of B-CLPD is a promising tool for standardized interpretation of tumor IP, their classification into well-defined entities and comprehensive evaluation of antibody panels.},

abstract = {The issue of large-scale testing has caught much attention with the advent of high-throughput technologies. In genomic studies, researchers are often confronted with a large number of tests. To make simultaneous inference for the many tests, the false discovery rate (FDR) control provides a practical balance between the number of true positives and the number of false positives. However, when few hypotheses are truly non-null, controlling the FDR may not provide additional advantages over controlling the family-wise error rate (e.g., the Bonferroni correction). To facilitate discoveries from a study, weighting tests according to prior information is a promising strategy. A 'weighted FDR control' (WEI) and a 'prioritized subset analysis' (PSA) have caught much attention. In this work, we compare the two weighting schemes with systematic simulation studies and demonstrate their use with a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on type 1 diabetes provided by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. The PSA and the WEI both can increase power when the prior is informative. With accurate and precise prioritization, the PSA can especially create substantial power improvements over the commonly-used whole-genome single-step FDR adjustment (i.e., the traditional un-weighted FDR control). When the prior is uninformative (true disease susceptibility regions are not prioritized), the power loss of the PSA and the WEI is almost negligible. However, a caution is that the overall FDR of the PSA can be slightly inflated if the prioritization is not accurate and precise. Our study highlights the merits of using information from mounting genetic studies, and provides insights to choose an appropriate weighting scheme to FDR control on GWAS.},

KIR recognition of major histocompatability complex (MHC) class I allotypes represents one component of the complex interactions between NK cells and their targets in determining NK cell reactivity. KIRs are encoded by a gene cluster at human chromosome 19q13.4. Despite their high degree of sequence identity, KIR genes encode proteins that have diverse recognition patterns (specific HLA class I allotypes) and confer opposing signals (activating or inhibitory) to the NK cell. The KIR gene cluster is highly polymorphic, with individual genes exhibiting allelic variability and individual haplotypes differing in gene content. The polymorphism of the KIR locus parallels that of the MHC, facilitating the adaptation of the immune system to a dynamic, challenging environment. This variation is associated with a growing number of human diseases, which is likely to extend to levels observed for the HLA loci. Here we review current progress in understanding KIR biology and genetics.},

abstract = {An extensive family-based study of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) cluster was performed. We aimed to describe the LD structure in the KIR gene cluster using a sample of 418 founder haplotypes identified by segregation in a group of 106 families from Northern Ireland. The LD was studied at two levels of polymorphism: the structural level (presence or absence of KIR genes) and the allelic level (between alleles of KIR genes). LD was further assessed using the predictive value of one KIR polymorphism for another one in order to provide an interpretative framework for the LD effect in association studies. In line with previous research, distinct patterns of KIR genetic diversity within the genomic region centromeric to KIR2DL4 (excluding KIR2DL4) and within the telomeric region including KIR2DL4 were found. In a comprehensive PPV/NPV-based LD analysis within the KIR cluster, robust tag markers were found that can be used to identify which genes are concomitantly present or absent and to further identify groups of associated KIR alleles. Several extended KIR haplotypes in the study population were identified (KIR2DS2*POS-KIR2DL2*001-KIR2DL5B*002-KIR2DS3*00103-KIR2DL1*00401; KIR2DL4*011-KIR3DL1/S1*005-KIR2DS4*003-KIR3DL2*003; KIR2DL4*00802-KIR3DL1/S1*004-KIR2DS4*006-KIR3DL2*005; KIR2DL4*00801-KIR3DL1/S1*00101-KIR2DS4*003-KIR3DL2*001; KIR2DL4*00103-KIR3DL1/S1*008-KIR2DS4*003-KIR3DL2*009; KIR2DL4*00102-KIR3DL1/S1*01502/*002-KIR2DS4*00101-KIR3DL2*002; KIR2DL4*00501-KIR3DL1/S1*013-KIR2DL5A*001-KIR2DS5*002-KIR2DS1*002-KIR3DL2*007).

abstract = {The immune responses of natural killer cells are regulated, in part, by killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). The 16 closely-related genes in the KIR gene system have been diversified by gene duplication and unequal crossing over, thereby generating haplotypes with variation in gene copy number. Allelic variation also contributes to diversity within the complex. In this study, we estimated allele-level haplotype frequencies and pairwise linkage disequilibrium statistics for 14 KIR loci. The typing utilized multiple methodologies by four laboratories to provide at least 2x coverage for each allele. The computational methods generated maximum-likelihood estimates of allele-level haplotypes. Our results indicate the most extensive allele diversity was observed for the KIR framework genes and for the genes localized to the telomeric region of the KIR A haplotype. Particular alleles of the stimulatory loci appear to be nearly fixed on specific, common haplotypes while many of the less frequent alleles of the inhibitory loci appeared on multiple haplotypes, some with common haplotype structures. Haplotype structures cA01 and/or tA01 predominate in this cohort, as has been observed in most populations worldwide. Linkage disequilibrium is high within the centromeric and telomeric haplotype regions but not between them and is particularly strong between centromeric gene pairs KIR2DL5∼KIR2DS3S5 and KIR2DS3S5∼KIR2DL1, and telomeric KIR3DL1∼KIR2DS4. Although 93% of the individuals have unique pairs of full-length allelic haplotypes, large genomic blocks sharing specific sets of alleles are seen in the most frequent haplotypes. These high-resolution, high-quality haplotypes extend our basic knowledge of the KIR gene system and may be used to support clinical studies beyond single gene analysis.},

abstract = {Flow cytometers, like all things electronic, have undergone rapid evolution since the introduction of the first commercial instruments 30 years ago. Cytometers then had so little automation and sophistication that the operator had to be expert in many different scientific disciplines to be able to coax any data at all out of the instrument. But trends in electronic components toward higher speed, smaller size, and lower power consumption have allowed the instruments to become faster, more sensitive, and actually quasi-intelligent. Automation of complex processes that once required considerable operator expertise, such as running a high-speed sort or correctly compensating a multicolor experiment, has expanded the number of flow cytometry applications and the number of flow cytometry users; there is no reason to expect that trend to stop. This review discusses the electronic components of a current "generic" flow cytometer from a functional point of view with the hope that a better understanding of what is going on "inside the box" will lead to a better understanding of how operator-selectable instrument settings can influence the quality of the data produced.},

abstract = {Functional cell-to-cell variability is ubiquitous in multicellular organisms as well as bacterial populations. Even genetically identical cells of the same cell type can respond differently to identical stimuli. Methods have been developed to analyse heterogeneous populations, e.g., mixture models and stochastic population models. The available methods are, however, either incapable of simultaneously analysing different experimental conditions or are computationally demanding and difficult to apply. Furthermore, they do not account for biological information available in the literature. To overcome disadvantages of existing methods, we combine mixture models and ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. The ODE models provide a mechanistic description of the underlying processes while mixture models provide an easy way to capture variability. In a simulation study, we show that the class of ODE constrained mixture models can unravel the subpopulation structure and determine the sources of cell-to-cell variability. In addition, the method provides reliable estimates for kinetic rates and subpopulation characteristics. We use ODE constrained mixture modelling to study NGF-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation in primary sensory neurones, a process relevant in inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We propose a mechanistic pathway model for this process and reconstructed static and dynamical subpopulation characteristics across experimental conditions. We validate the model predictions experimentally, which verifies the capabilities of ODE constrained mixture models. These results illustrate that ODE constrained mixture models can reveal novel mechanistic insights and possess a high sensitivity.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for type 1 diabetes (T1D) have successfully identified more than 40 independent T1D associated tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, owing to technical limitations of copy number variants (CNVs) genotyping assays, the assessment of the role of CNVs has been limited to the subset of these in high linkage disequilibrium with tag SNPs. The contribution of untagged CNVs, often multi-allelic and difficult to genotype using existing assays, to the heritability of T1D remains an open question. To investigate this issue, we designed a custom comparative genetic hybridization array (aCGH) specifically designed to assay untagged CNV loci identified from a variety of sources. To overcome the technical limitations of the case control design for this class of CNVs, we genotyped the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC) family resource (representing 3,903 transmissions from parents to affected offspring) and used an association testing strategy that does not necessitate obtaining discrete genotypes. Our design targeted 4,309 CNVs, of which 3,410 passed stringent quality control filters. As a positive control, the scan confirmed the known T1D association at the INS locus by direct typing of the 5' variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) locus. Our results clarify the fact that the disease association is indistinguishable from the two main polymorphic allele classes of the INS VNTR, class I-and class III. We also identified novel technical artifacts resulting into spurious associations at the somatically rearranging loci, T cell receptor, TCRA/TCRD and TCRB, and Immunoglobulin heavy chain, IGH, loci on chromosomes 14q11.2, 7q34 and 14q32.33, respectively. However, our data did not identify novel T1D loci. Our results do not support a major role of untagged CNVs in T1D heritability.},

abstract = {We present an electronic scheme that enables us to use a photon-counting device (photomultiplier or avalanche photodetector) for measuring extremely weak signals in a flow cytometer. It can be used as a sole detector, or in combination with other (conventional) detectors using the data acquisition hardware of a conventional flow cytometer. The essential principle is that photon-counting pulses are converted to an analogue signal that is continuously proportional to the number of detected photons during the last integration time. The integration time should be approximately equal to the time an object is illuminated in the flow chamber. In this way, the photon burst due to real events is measured correctly and discriminated from the background pulses (fluorescence and Raman). The use of this scheme for the measurement of single DNA molecules is illustrated.},

abstract = {In summary, a beginner requires fundamental knowledge about flow cytometric instrumentation in order to effectively use this technology. It is important to remember that flow cytometers are very complex instruments that are composed of four closely related systems. The fluidic system transports particles from a suspension through the cytometer for interrogation by an illumination system. The resulting light scattering and fluorescence is collected, filtered, and converted into electrical signals by the optical and electronics system. The data storage and computer control system saves acquired data and is also the user interface for controlling most instrument functions. These four systems provide a very unique and powerful analytical tool for researchers and clinicians. This is because they analyze the properties of individual particles, and thousands of particles can be analyzed in a matter of seconds. Thus, data for a flow cytometric sample are a collection of many measurements instead of a single bulk measurement. Basic knowledge of instrumentation is a tremendous aid to designing experiments that can be successfully analyzed using flow cytometry. For example, it is important to know the emission wavelength of the laser in the instrument that will be used for analysis. This wavelength is critical knowledge for selecting probes. It is also important to understand that a different range of wavelengths is detected for each fluorescent channel. This will aid selection of probes that are compatible with the flow cytometer. Understanding the complication that emission spectra overlap contributes to detection can be used to guide fluorochrome selections for multicolor analysis. All of these experiment design considerations that rely on knowledge of how flow cytometers work are a very practical and effective means of avoiding wasted time, energy, and costly reagents. Data analysis is a paramount issue in flow cytometry. Analysis includes interpreting as well as presenting data that has been stored in list-mode files. Data analysis is very graphically oriented. There are a number of types of graphic representation that are available to visually aid data analysis. Two standard types of displays are used. These data plots are one-parameter histograms and bivariate plots. A user must be familiar with these two fundamental types of display in order to effectively analyze data. Histograms are the most simple modes of data representation. Histograms allow visualization of a single acquired parameter. Mean fluorescence and distributional statistics can be obtained based on markers that the user can graphically set on the plot. Percentages of positively expressing particles relative to a control sample can also obtained in a similar manner. In addition, multiple histograms can be overlayed on one another to depict qualitative and quantitative differences in two or more samples. Two-parameter data plots are somewhat more complicated than histograms; however, they can yield more information. Two-parameter dot plots of FSC vs SSC allow visualization of both light-scattering parameters that are important for identifying populations of interest. Bivariate fluorescent plots allow discrimination of dual-labeled populations that might remain hidden if histograms were used to display fluorescent data. Two-parameter plots that combine one light-scattering parameter and a fluorescent parameter are useful for analyzing control samples to elucidate the origin of nonspecific binding. Data analysis is very graphically oriented. Experience and pattern recognition become important when using two-parameter data plots for qualitative as well as quantitative analysis. The technique of gating or drawing regions on dual parameter light-scatter plots allows one to exclude information and examine the population of interest by disallowing particles that might confound or interfere with analysis. This is one of the fundamental uses for gating. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:While several algorithms for the comparison of univariate distributions arising from flow cytometric analyses have been developed and studied for many years, algorithms for comparing multivariate distributions remain elusive. Such algorithms could be useful for comparing differences between samples based on several independent measurements, rather than differences based on any single measurement. It is conceivable that distributions could be completely distinct in multivariate space, but unresolvable in any combination of univariate histograms. Multivariate comparisons could also be useful for providing feedback about instrument stability, when only subtle changes in measurements are occurring.

METHODS:We apply a variant of Probability Binning, described in the accompanying article, to multidimensional data. In this approach, hyper-rectangles of n dimensions (where n is the number of measurements being compared) comprise the bins used for the chi-squared statistic. These hyper-dimensional bins are constructed such that the control sample has the same number of events in each bin; the bins are then applied to the test samples for chi-squared calculations.

RESULTS:Using a Monte-Carlo simulation, we determined the distribution of chi-squared values obtained by comparing sets of events from the same distribution; this distribution of chi-squared values was identical as for the univariate algorithm. Hence, the same formulae can be used to construct a metric, analogous to a t-score, that estimates the probability with which distributions are distinct. As for univariate comparisons, this metric scales with the difference between two distributions, and can be used to rank samples according to similarity to a control. We apply the algorithm to multivariate immunophenotyping data, and demonstrate that it can be used to discriminate distinct samples and to rank samples according to a biologically-meaningful difference.

CONCLUSION:Probability binning, as shown here, provides a useful metric for determining the probability with which two or more multivariate distributions represent distinct sets of data. The metric can be used to identify the similarity or dissimilarity of samples. Finally, as demonstrated in the accompanying paper, the algorithm can be used to gate on events in one sample that are different from a control sample, even if those events cannot be distinguished on the basis of any combination of univariate or bivariate displays.

Here, we introduce PT/PA technique based on detection of negative signals below background. Among various new applications, we propose label-free in vivo flow cytometry of circulating clots. No method has been developed for the early detection of clots of different compositions as a source of thromboembolism including ischemia at strokes and myocardial infarction. When a low-absorbing, platelet-rich clot passes a laser-irradiated vessel volume, a transient decrease in local absorption results in an ultrasharp negative PA hole in blood background. Using this phenomenon alone or in combination with positive contrasts, we demonstrated identification of white, red, and mixed clots on a mouse model of myocardial infarction and human blood. The concentration and size of clots were measured with threshold down to few clots in the entire circulation with size as low as 20 $\mu$m. This multiparameter diagnostic platform using portable personal high-speed flow cytometer with negative dynamic contrast mode has potential to real-time defining risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, and for prognosis and prevention of stroke or use clot count as a marker of therapy efficacy. Possibility for label-free detection of platelets, leukocytes, tumor cells or targeting themby negative PA probes (e.g., nonabsorbing beads or bubbles) is also highlighted.},

As a proof of this concept, we demonstrate in vivo real-time photoacoustic monitoring of quantum dot-carbon nanotube conjugates uptake by roots and spreading through stem to leaves in a tomato plant. In addition, in vivo scanning cytometry using multimodal photoacoustic, photothermal, and fluorescent detection schematics provided multiplex detection and identification of nanoparticles accumulated in plant leaves in the presence of intensive absorption, scattering, and autofluorescent backgrounds. The use of a portable fiber-based photoacoustic flow cytometer for studies of plant vasculature was demonstrated.

With RNA interference (RNAi), highly parallel phenotyping of loss-of-function effects in cells has become feasible. One of the current challenges however is the computational categorization of visual phenotypes and the prediction of biological function and processes. In this study, we describe a combined computational and experimental approach to discover novel gene functions and explore functional relationships. We performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in human cells and used quantitative descriptors derived from high-throughput imaging to generate multiparametric phenotypic profiles. We show that profiles predicted functions of genes by phenotypic similarity. Specifically, we examined several candidates including the largely uncharacterized gene DONSON, which shared phenotype similarity with known factors of DNA damage response (DDR) and genomic integrity. Experimental evidence supports that DONSON is a novel centrosomal protein required for DDR signalling and genomic integrity. Multiparametric phenotyping by automated imaging and computational annotation is a powerful method for functional discovery and mapping the landscape of phenotypic responses to cellular perturbations.},

were identified using manual gating.  Here we use the repeatability of
these phenotypes as an independent measure for assessing the
performance of a variety of automated gating strategies.

First, we gated data from six bead populations over a period of 55
days. Second, we gated seven stable phenotypes in three subsets of CD4+
lymphocyte populations.  Specifically, these were the proportion of
CD4+ lymphocytes which fell into each of three subsets (memory T cells
(CD45RA-), naive T cells (CD45RA+) and regulatory T cells (FOXP3+));
the expression of CD25 in each cell subset as measured by mean
fluorescence intensity and the proportion of naive cells which were
CD25 positive.  We normalized the mean intensity by the Molecules of
Equivalent Fluorescence (MEF) coefficient obtained from running the
beads on that day.  Manual gating was performed using FlowJo.

Results

We found that automated methods appear to be sufficiently mature to
replace manual gating for bead data at least.  However, for the seven
repeatable CD4 phenotypes, manual gating tended to provide better
repeatability.  In some cases this was minimal, with the expression
of CD25 on memory T cells showing r-squared=0.999 in manual gating
versus 0.994 using CurvHDR.  In other cases, the difference was more
marked, with r-squared for CD25 expression on naive cells of 0.911
using manual gating versus, for example, 0.414 using CurvHDR and 0.416
using flowMeans.  Furthermore FlowMeans failed to find a solution when
attempting to distinguish T cell subpopulations in approximately 50%
of samples and in nine out of 14 pairs considered, estimated a
different number of clusters on the two samples.

Conclusion

Though automatic gating provides good repeatability on bead data,
performance deteriorates on less clearly separated
phenotypes. Flowmeans tended to outperform curvHDR, particularly as it
can incorporate prior information about the number of clusters when
known and can be applied to more than two dimensions.  We
examine in detail cases where automated gating fails catastrophically.
The inability of many existing algorithms to ``borrow'' information from
other samples motivates the development of hierarchical Bayesian
clustering models.},

abstract = {Increased numbers of T regulatory (T-reg) cells are found in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but the nature and function of these T-regs remains unclear. Detailed characterization of the T-regs in chronic lymphocytic leukemia has not been performed and the degree of heterogeneity of among these cells has not been studied to date. Using 15-color flow cytometry we show that T-reg, cells, defined using CD4, CD25, and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), can be divided into multiple complex subsets based on markers used for naive, memory, and effector delineation as well as markers of T-reg activation. Furthermore FOXP3 cells can be identified among CD4(+)CD25(-) as well as CD8(+)CD4(-) populations in increased proportions in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia compared with healthy donors. Significantly different frequencies of naive and effector T-regs populations are found in healthy donor controls compared with donors with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A population of CCR7(+)CD39(+) T-regs was significantly associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This population demonstrated slightly reduced suppressive activity compared with total T-regs Or T-regs of healthy donors. These data suggest that FOXP3-expressing cells, particularly in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia are much more complex for T-reg sub-populations and transitions than previously reported. These findings demonstrate the complexity of regulation of T-cell responses in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and illustrate the use of high-dimensional analysis of cellular phenotypes in facilitating understanding of the intricacies of cellular immune responses and their dysregulation in cancer.

abstract = {Background: The remarkable success of cytometry over the past 30 years is largely due to its uncanny ability to display populations that vastly differ in numbers and fluorescence intensities on one scale. The log transform implemented in hardware as a log amplifier or in software normalizes signals or channels so that these populations appear as clearly discernible peaks. With the advent of multiple fluorescence cytometry, spectral crossover compensation of these signals has been necessary to properly interpret the data. Unfortunately, because compensation is a subtractive process, it can produce negative and zero valued data. The log transform is undefined for these values and, as a result, forces computer algorithms to truncate these values, creating a few problems for cytometrists. Data truncation biases displays making properly compensated data appear undercompensated; thus, enticing many operators to overcompensate their data. Also, events truncated into the first histogram channel are not normally visible with typical two-dimensional graphic displays, thus hiding a large number of events and obscuring the true proportionality of negative distributions. In addition, the log transform creates unequal binning that can dramatically distort negative population distributions.Methods and Results: The HyperLog transform is a log-like transform that admits negative, zero, and positive values. The transform is a hybrid type of transform specifically designed for compensated data. One of its parameters allows it to smoothly transition from a logarithmic to linear type of transform that is ideal for compensated data.Conclusions: The HyperLog transform is easily implemented in computer systems and results in display systems that present compensated data in an unbiased manner.

abstract = {A new variational Bayesian learning algorithm for Student-t mixture models is introduced. This algorithm leads to (i) robust density estimation, (ii) robust clustering and (iii) robust automatic model selection. Gaussian mixture models are learning machines which are based on a divide-and-conquer approach. They are commonly used for density estimation and clustering tasks, but are sensitive to outliers. The Student-t distribution has heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution and is therefore less sensitive to any departure of the empirical distribution from Gaussianity. As a consequence, the Student-t distribution is suitable for constructing robust mixture models. In this work, we formalize the Bayesian Student-t mixture model as a latent variable model in a different way from Svens{\'e}n and Bishop [Svens{\'e}n, M.,  Bishop, C. M. (2005). Robust Bayesian mixture modelling. Neurocomputing, 64, 235-252]. The main difference resides in the fact that it is not necessary to assume a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution on the latent indicator variables and the latent scale variables in order to obtain a tractable solution. Not neglecting the correlations between these unobserved random variables leads to a Bayesian model having an increased robustness. Furthermore, it is expected that the lower bound on the log-evidence is tighter. Based on this bound, the model complexity, i.e. the number of components in the mixture, can be inferred with a higher confidence.},

Using these values, a simple mathematical calculation then determines the relative intensity of a fluorescent signal, even for samples differing in intensity by several orders of magnitude.},

We present Cuffdiff 2, an algorithm that estimates expression at transcript-level resolution and controls for variability evident across replicate libraries. Cuffdiff 2 robustly identifies differentially expressed transcripts and genes and reveals differential splicing and promoter-preference changes. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach through differential analysis of lung fibroblasts in response to loss of the developmental transcription factor HOXA1, which we show is required for lung fibroblast and HeLa cell cycle progression. Loss of HOXA1 results in significant expression level changes in thousands of individual transcripts, along with isoform switching events in key regulators of the cell cycle. Cuffdiff 2 performs robust differential analysis in RNA-seq experiments at transcript resolution, revealing a layer of regulation not readily observable with other high-throughput technologies.},

Discovered as a T cell growth factor, IL-2 additionally promotes CD8(+) T cell and natural killer cell cytolytic activity and modulates T cell differentiation programs in response to antigen, promoting na{\"\i}ve CD4(+) T cell differentiation into T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) cells while inhibiting T helper 17 (Th17) and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation. Moreover, IL-2 is essential for the development and maintenance of T regulatory cells and for activation-induced cell death, thereby mediating tolerance and limiting inappropriate immune reactions. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms and complex cellular actions of IL-2, its cooperative and opposing effects with other cytokines, and how both promoting and blocking the actions of IL-2 are being utilized in clinical medicine.},

abstract = {Twin studies are powerful tools to discriminate whether a complex disease is due to genetic or environmental factors. High concordance rates among monozygotic (MZ) twins support genetic factors being predominantly involved, whilst low rates are suggestive of environmental factors. Twin studies have often been utilised in the study of systemic and organ specific autoimmune diseases. As an example, type I diabetes mellitus has been investigated to establish that that disease is largely affected by genetic factors, compared to rheumatoid arthritis or scleroderma, which have a weaker genetic association. However, large twin studies are scarce or virtually non-existent in other autoimmune diseases which have been limited to few sets of twins and individual case reports. In addition to the study of the genetic and environmental contributions to disease, it is likely that twin studies will also provide data in regards to the clinical course of disease, as well as risk for development in related individuals. More importantly, genome-wide association studies have thus far reported genomic variants that only account for a minority of autoimmunity cases, and cannot explain disease discordance in MZ twins. Future research is therefore encouraged not only in the analysis of twins with autoimmune disease, but also in regards to epigenetic factors or rare variants that may be discovered with next-generation sequencing. This review will examine the literature surrounding twin studies in autoimmune disease including discussions of genetics and gender.},

abstract = {Human genetics has been haunted by the mystery of "missing heritability" of common traits. Although studies have discovered >1,200 variants associated with common diseases and traits, these variants typically appear to explain only a minority of the heritability. The proportion of heritability explained by a set of variants is the ratio of (i) the heritability due to these variants (numerator), estimated directly from their observed effects, to (ii) the total heritability (denominator), inferred indirectly from population data. The prevailing view has been that the explanation for missing heritability lies in the numerator--that is, in as-yet undiscovered variants. While many variants surely remain to be found, we show here that a substantial portion of missing heritability could arise from overestimation of the denominator, creating "phantom heritability." Specifically, (i) estimates of total heritability implicitly assume the trait involves no genetic interactions (epistasis) among loci; (ii) this assumption is not justified, because models with interactions are also consistent with observable data; and (iii) under such models, the total heritability may be much smaller and thus the proportion of heritability explained much larger. For example, 80% of the currently missing heritability for Crohn's disease could be due to genetic interactions, if the disease involves interaction among three pathways. In short, missing heritability need not directly correspond to missing variants, because current estimates of total heritability may be significantly inflated by genetic interactions. Finally, we describe a method for estimating heritability from isolated populations that is not inflated by genetic interactions.},

abstract = {Although whole-genome association studies using tagSNPs are a powerful approach for detecting common variants, they are underpowered for detecting associations with rare variants. Recent studies have demonstrated that common diseases can be due to functional variants with a wide spectrum of allele frequencies, ranging from rare to common. An effective way to identify rare variants is through direct sequencing. The development of cost-effective sequencing technologies enables association studies to use sequence data from candidate genes and, in the future, from the entire genome. Although methods used for analysis of common variants are applicable to sequence data, their performance might not be optimal. In this study, it is shown that the collapsing method, which involves collapsing genotypes across variants and applying a univariate test, is powerful for analyzing rare variants, whereas multivariate analysis is robust against inclusion of noncausal variants. Both methods are superior to analyzing each variant individually with univariate tests. In order to unify the advantages of both collapsing and multiple-marker tests, we developed the Combined Multivariate and Collapsing (CMC) method and demonstrated that the CMC method is both powerful and robust. The CMC method can be applied to either candidate-gene or whole-genome sequence data.},

This observation has been responsible for precautionary removal of large amounts of summary data from public access. This and further work on the problem has followed a frequentist approach.

abstract = {If trait-associated variants alter regulatory regions, then they should fall within chromatin marks in relevant cell types. However, it is unclear which of the many marks are most useful in defining cell types associated with disease and fine mapping variants. We hypothesized that informative marks are phenotypically cell type specific; that is, SNPs associated with the same trait likely overlap marks in the same cell type. We examined 15 chromatin marks and found that those highlighting active gene regulation were phenotypically cell type specific. Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) was the most phenotypically cell type specific (P < 1 × 10(-6)), driven by colocalization of variants and marks rather than gene proximity (P < 0.001). H3K4me3 peaks overlapped with 37 SNPs for plasma low-density lipoprotein concentration in the liver (P < 7 × 10(-5)), 31 SNPs for rheumatoid arthritis within CD4(+) regulatory T cells (P = 1 × 10(-4)), 67 SNPs for type 2 diabetes in pancreatic islet cells (P = 0.003) and the liver (P = 0.003), and 14 SNPs for neuropsychiatric disease in neuronal tissues (P = 0.007). We show how cell type-specific H3K4me3 peaks can inform the fine mapping of associated SNPs to identify causal variation.},

abstract = {The completion of a draft sequence of the human genome and the promise of rapid single-nucleotide-polymorphism-genotyping technologies have resulted in a call for the abandonment of linkage studies in favor of genome scans for association. However, there exists a large class of genetic models for which this approach will fail: purely epistatic models with no additive or dominance variation at any of the susceptibility loci. As a result, traditional association methods (such as case/control, measured genotype, and transmission/disequilibrium test [TDT]) will have no power if the loci are examined individually. In this article, we examine this class of models, delimiting the range of genetic determination and recurrence risks for two-, three-, and four-locus purely epistatic models. Our study reveals that these models, although giving rise to no additive or dominance variation, do give rise to increased allele sharing between affected sibs. Thus, a genome scan for linkage could detect genomic subregions harboring susceptibility loci. We also discuss some simple multilocus extensions of single-locus analysis methods, including a conditional form of the TDT.},

abstract = {Genetic association studies have been less successful than expected in detecting causal genetic variants, with frequent non-replication when such variants are claimed. Numerous possible reasons have been postulated, including inadequate sample size and possible unobserved stratification. Another possibility, and the focus of this paper, is that of epistasis, or gene-gene interaction. Although unlikely that we may glean information about disease mechanism, based purely upon the data, it may be possible to increase our power to detect an effect by allowing for epistasis within our test statistic. This paper derives an appropriate "omnibus" test for detecting causal loci whist allowing for numerous possible interactions and compares the power of such a test with that of the usual main effects test. This approach differs from that commonly used, for example by Marchini et al. [2005], in that it tests simultaneously for main effects and interactions, rather than interactions alone. The alternative hypothesis being tested by the "omnibus" test is whether a particular locus of interest has an effect on disease status, either marginally or epistatically and is therefore directly comparable to the main effects test at that locus. The paper begins by considering the direct case, in which the putative causal variants are observed and then extends these ideas to the indirect case in which the causal variants are unobserved and we have a set of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tag SNPs) representing the regions of interest. In passing, the derivation of the indirect omnibus test statistic leads to a novel "indirect case-only test for interaction".},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:There are many important clustering questions in computational biology for which no satisfactory method exists. Automated clustering algorithms, when applied to large, multidimensional datasets, such as flow cytometry data, prove unsatisfactory in terms of speed, problems with local minima or cluster shape bias. Model-based approaches are restricted by the assumptions of the fitting functions. Furthermore, model based clustering requires serial clustering for all cluster numbers within a user defined interval. The final cluster number is then selected by various criteria. These supervised serial clustering methods are time consuming and frequently different criteria result in different optimal cluster numbers. Various unsupervised heuristic approaches that have been developed such as affinity propagation are too expensive to be applied to datasets on the order of 106 points that are often generated by high throughput experiments.

RESULTS:To circumvent these limitations, we developed a new, unsupervised density contour clustering algorithm, called Misty Mountain, that is based on percolation theory and that efficiently analyzes large data sets. The approach can be envisioned as a progressive top-down removal of clouds covering a data histogram relief map to identify clusters by the appearance of statistically distinct peaks and ridges. This is a parallel clustering method that finds every cluster after analyzing only once the cross sections of the histogram. The overall run time for the composite steps of the algorithm increases linearly by the number of data points. The clustering of 106 data points in 2D data space takes place within about 15 seconds on a standard laptop PC. Comparison of the performance of this algorithm with other state of the art automated flow cytometry gating methods indicate that Misty Mountain provides substantial improvements in both run time and in the accuracy of cluster assignment.

CONCLUSIONS:Misty Mountain is fast, unbiased for cluster shape, identifies stable clusters and is robust to noise. It provides a useful, general solution for multidimensional clustering problems. We demonstrate its suitability for automated gating of flow cytometry data.},

abstract = {For many traits, including susceptibility to common diseases in humans, causal loci uncovered by genetic-mapping studies explain only a minority of the heritable contribution to trait variation. Multiple explanations for this 'missing heritability' have been proposed. Here we use a large cross between two yeast strains to accurately estimate different sources of heritable variation for 46 quantitative traits, and to detect underlying loci with high statistical power. We find that the detected loci explain nearly the entire additive contribution to heritable variation for the traits studied. We also show that the contribution to heritability of gene-gene interactions varies among traits, from near zero to approximately 50 per cent. Detected two-locus interactions explain only a minority of this contribution. These results substantially advance our understanding of the missing heritability problem and have important implications for future studies of complex and quantitative traits.},

abstract = {Despite the growing consensus on the importance of testing gene-gene interactions in genetic studies of complex diseases, the effect of gene-gene interactions has often been defined as a deviance from genetic additive effects, which is essentially treated as a residual term in genetic analysis and leads to low power in detecting the presence of interacting effects. To what extent the definition of gene-gene interaction at population level reflects the genes' biochemical or physiological interaction remains a mystery. In this article, we introduce a novel definition and a new measure of gene-gene interaction between two unlinked loci (or genes). We developed a general theory for studying linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in disease population under two-locus disease models. The properties of using the LD measure in a disease population as a function of the measure of gene-gene interaction between two unlinked loci were also investigated. We examined how interaction between two loci creates LD in a disease population and showed that the mathematical formulation of the new definition for gene-gene interaction between two loci was similar to that of the LD between two loci. This finding motived us to develop an LD-based statistic to detect gene-gene interaction between two unlinked loci. The null distribution and type I error rates of the LD-based statistic for testing gene-gene interaction were validated using extensive simulation studies. We found that the new test statistic was more powerful than the traditional logistic regression under three two-locus disease models and demonstrated that the power of the test statistic depends on the measure of gene-gene interaction. We also investigated the impact of using tagging SNPs for testing interaction on the power to detect interaction between two unlinked loci. Finally, to evaluate the performance of our new method, we applied the LD-based statistic to two published data sets. Our results showed that the P values of the LD-based statistic were smaller than those obtained by other approaches, including logistic regression models.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:In multicolor flow cytometric analysis, compensation for spectral overlap is nearly always necessary. For the most part, such compensation has been relatively simple, producing the desired rectilinear distributions. However, in the realm of multicolor analysis, visualization of compensated often results in unexpected distributions, principally the appearance of a large number of events on the axis, and even more disconcerting, an inability to bring the extent of compensated data down to "autofluorescence" levels.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:A mathematical model of detector measurements with variable photon intensities, spillover parameters, measurement errors, and data storage characteristics was used to illustrate sources of apparent error in compensated data. Immunofluorescently stained cells were collected under conditions of limiting light collection and high spillover between detectors to confirm aspects of the model.

RESULTS:Photon-counting statistics contribute a nonlinear error to compensated parameters. Measurement errors and log-scale binning error contribute linear errors to compensated parameters. These errors are most apparent with the use of red or far-red fluorochromes (where the emitted light is at low intensity) and with large spillover between detectors. Such errors can lead to data visualization artifacts that can easily lead to incorrect conclusions about data, and account for the apparent "undercompensation" previously described for multicolor staining.

CONCLUSIONS:There are inescapable errors arising from imperfect measurements, photon-counting statistics, and even data storage methods that contribute both linearly and nonlinearly to a "spreading" of a properly compensated autofluorescence distribution. This phenomenon precludes the use of "quadrant" statistics or gates to analyze affected data; it also precludes visual adjustment of compensation. Most importantly, it is impossible to properly compensate data using standard visual graphical interfaces (histograms or dot plots). Computer-assisted compensation is required, as well as careful gating and experimental design to determine the distinction between positive and negative events.

abstract = {Traditional methods for flow cytometry (FCM) data processing rely on subjective manual gating. Recently, several groups have developed computational methods for identifying cell populations in multidimensional FCM data. The Flow Cytometry: Critical Assessment of Population Identification Methods (FlowCAP) challenges were established to compare the performance of these methods on two tasks: (i) mammalian cell population identification, to determine whether automated algorithms can reproduce expert manual gating and (ii) sample classification, to determine whether analysis pipelines can identify characteristics that correlate with external variables (such as clinical outcome). This analysis presents the results of the first FlowCAP challenges. Several methods performed well as compared to manual gating or external variables using statistical performance measures, which suggests that automated methods have reached a sufficient level of maturity and accuracy for reliable use in FCM data analysis.},

Delivering maximum sensitivity and resolution required for multicolor applications, the special order BD LSRFortessa cell analyzer supports up to 7 lasers and can be used to detect 18 colors simultaneously. In addition to the reduced size, design innovations make filters and detectors more accessible, for easier setup of new experiments.},

Manual scoring of i-FISH signals is a labor intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone process liable to subjective interpretation. Automated evaluation of signal patterns provides the opportunity to overcome these difficulties. The first report on automated i-FISH analysis has been published 20 years ago and since then several applications have been introduced in the fields of oncology, and prenatal and fertility screening. In this article, we provide an insight into the automated i-FISH analysis including its course, brief history, clinical applications, and advantages and challenges. The lack of guidelines for describing new automated i-FISH methods hampers the precise comparison of performance of various applications published, thus, we make a proposal for a panel of parameters essential to introduce and standardize new applications and reproduce previously described technologies. {\copyright} 2012 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.},

In this report, we describe a simplified procedural modification which enables the rapid detection of low frequency memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells expressing cytokines in response to soluble antigen in whole blood. When compared with T cell responses in PBMC cultures, whole blood cultures demonstrated similar but slightly higher percentages of T cells responsive to specific antigen. In addition, T cell responses to cytomegalovirus in whole blood were observed only in sensitized (seropositive) individuals, and CD4 + T cell responses could be blocked by anti-class II MHC antibodies. This procedure may provide a means to examine direct effects of pharmacological drug concentrations on T cell immunity in clinical samples. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Here we describe a long-lived human memory T cell population that has an enhanced capacity for self-renewal and a multipotent ability to derive central memory, effector memory and effector T cells. These cells, specific to multiple viral and self-tumor antigens, were found within a CD45RO(-), CCR7(+), CD45RA(+), CD62L(+), CD27(+), CD28(+) and IL-7R$\alpha$(+) T cell compartment characteristic of naive T cells. However, they expressed large amounts of CD95, IL-2R$\beta$, CXCR3, and LFA-1, and showed numerous functional attributes distinctive of memory cells. Compared with known memory populations, these lymphocytes had increased proliferative capacity and more efficiently reconstituted immunodeficient hosts, and they mediated superior antitumor responses in a humanized mouse model. The identification of a human stem cell-like memory T cell population is of direct relevance to the design of vaccines and T cell therapies.},

The ISHAGE single-platform gating method is considered by many to be the standard for CD34+ SC enumeration. However, attempts at uniform application of this ISHAGE method have met with only partial success. We propose an automated, multivariate classification approach for SC analysis based on Probability State Modeling{\texttrademark} (PSM). In this study, we compare the results from automated PSM analysis with manual ISHAGE gating analysis as performed by a trained analyst.

METHODS:A total of 258 samples were assayed on BD FACSCanto II flow cytometers using a stain-lyse-no-wash technique. Populations were defined using CD34, CD45, 7-AAD, and light scatter. BD TruCount{\texttrademark} bead tubes were used for absolute SC concentrations. A PSM was designed to classify events into beads, debris, intact-dead cells, and intact-live SC; run unattended and record results.

RESULTS:The ISHAGE and PSM methods show excellent agreement in estimating the concentration of {\#}SC/$\mu$L: slope = 1.009, r² = 0.999. Bland-Altman Analysis for the SC concentration has an average difference (bias) of 2.018 SC/$\mu$L. The 95% confidence interval is from -59.350 to 63.380 SC/$\mu$L. The operator-to-operator agreement using PSM is perfect: r² = 1.000.

CONCLUSIONS:Automated PSM analysis of SC listmode data produces results that agree strongly with ISHAGE gate-based results. The PSM approach provides higher reproducibility, objectivity, and speed with accuracy at least equivalent to the ISHAGE method.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Technological developments have increased the feasibility of large scale genetic association studies. Densely typed genetic markers are obtained using SNP arrays, next-generation sequencing technologies and imputation. However, SNPs typed using these methods can be highly correlated due to linkage disequilibrium among them, and standard multiple regression techniques fail with these data sets due to their high dimensionality and correlation structure. There has been increasing interest in using penalised regression in the analysis of high dimensional data. Ridge regression is one such penalised regression technique which does not perform variable selection, instead estimating a regression coefficient for each predictor variable. It is therefore desirable to obtain an estimate of the significance of each ridge regression coefficient.

RESULTS:We develop and evaluate a test of significance for ridge regression coefficients. Using simulation studies, we demonstrate that the performance of the test is comparable to that of a permutation test, with the advantage of a much-reduced computational cost. We introduce the p-value trace, a plot of the negative logarithm of the p-values of ridge regression coefficients with increasing shrinkage parameter, which enables the visualisation of the change in p-value of the regression coefficients with increasing penalisation. We apply the proposed method to a lung cancer case-control data set from EPIC, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.

CONCLUSIONS:The proposed test is a useful alternative to a permutation test for the estimation of the significance of ridge regression coefficients, at a much-reduced computational cost. The p-value trace is an informative graphical tool for evaluating the results of a test of significance of ridge regression coefficients as the shrinkage parameter increases, and the proposed test makes its production computationally feasible.},

This can be thought of as an issue in variable selection for unsupervised learning. We demonstrate that by defining a hierarchical population based nonparametric prior on the cluster locations scaled by the inverse covariance matrices of the likelihood we arrive at a 'sparsity prior' representation which admits a conditionally conjugate prior. This allows us to perform full Gibbs sampling to obtain posterior distributions over parameters of interest including an explicit measure of each covariate's relevance and a distribution over the number of potential clusters present in the data. This also allows for individual cluster specific variable selection. We demonstrate improved inference on a number of canonical problems.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED:WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: The link between inflammation and cancer has long been reported and inflammation is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of many cancers, including prostate cancer (PrCa). Over the last 5 years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported numerous susceptibility loci that predispose individuals to many different traits. The present study aims to ascertain if there are common genetic risk profiles that might predispose individuals to both PrCa and the autoimmune inflammatory condition, rheumatoid arthritis. These results could have potential public heath impact in terms of screening and chemoprevention.

OBJECTIVES:To investigate if potential common pathways exist for the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease and prostate cancer (PrCa). To ascertain if the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as being associated with susceptibility to PrCa are also associated with susceptibility to the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS:The original Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) UK RA GWAS study was expanded to include a total of 3221 cases and 5272 controls. In all, 37 germline autosomal SNPs at genome-wide significance associated with PrCa risk were identified from a UK/Australian PrCa GWAS. Allele frequencies were compared for these 37 SNPs between RA cases and controls using a chi-squared trend test and corrected for multiple testing (Bonferroni).

RESULTS:In all, 33 SNPs were able to be analysed in the RA dataset. Proxies could not be located for the SNPs in 3q26, 5p15 and for two SNPs in 17q12. After applying a Bonferroni correction for the number of SNPs tested, the SNP mapping to CCHCR1 (rs130067) retained statistically significant evidence for association (P = 6 × 10(-4) ; odds ratio [OR] = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.06-1.24); this has also been associated with psoriasis. However, further analyses showed that the association of this allele was due to confounding by RA-associated HLA-DRB1 alleles.

CONCLUSIONS:There is currently no evidence that SNPs associated with PrCa at genome-wide significance are associated with the development of RA. Studies like this are important in determining if common genetic risk profiles might predispose individuals to many diseases, which could have implications for public health in terms of screening and chemoprevention.},

abstract = {Systematic study of cell signaling networks increasingly involves high throughput proteomics, transcriptional profiling, and automated literature mining with the aim of assembling large scale interaction networks. In contrast, functional analysis of cell signaling usually focuses on a much smaller sets of proteins and eschews computation but focuses directly on cellular responses to environment and perturbation. We sought to combine these two traditions by collecting cell response measures on a reasonably large scale and then attempting to infer differences in network topology between two cell types. Human hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines were exposed to inducers of inflammation, innate immunity, and proliferation in the presence and absence of small molecule drugs, and multiplex biochemical measurement was then performed on intra- and extracellular signaling molecules. We uncovered major differences between primary and transformed hepatocytes with respect to the engagement of toll-like receptor and NF-kappaB-dependent secretion of chemokines and cytokines that prime and attract immune cells. Overall, our results serve as a proof of principle for an approach to network analysis that is systematic, comparative, and biochemically focused. More specifically, our data support the hypothesis that hepatocellular carcinoma cells down-regulate normal inflammatory and immune responses to avoid immune editing.},

abstract = {This textbook provides a wide-ranging introduction to the use and theory of linear models for analyzing data. The author's emphasis is on providing a unified treatment of linear models, including analysis of variance models and regression models, based on projections, orthogonality, and other vector space ideas. Every chapter comes with numerous exercises and examples that make it ideal for a graduate-level course. All of the standard topics are covered in depth: ANOVA, estimation including Bayesian estimation, hypothesis testing, multiple comparisons, regression analysis, and experimental design models. In addition, the book covers topics that are not usually treated at this level, but which are important in their own right: balanced incomplete block designs, testing for lack of fit, testing for independence, models with singular covariance matrices, variance component estimation, best linear and best linear unbiased prediction, collinearity, and variable selection. This new edition includes a more extensive discussion of best prediction and associated ideas of R2, as well as new sections on inner products and perpendicular projections for more general spaces and Milliken and Graybill s generalization of Tukey s one degree of freedom for nonadditivity test.},

Using estimates of effect-size distribution and heritability derived from current studies, we project that although 45% of the variance of height has been attributed to SNPs, a model trained on one million people may only explain 33.4% of variance of the trait. Models based on current studies allow for identification of 3.0%, 1.1% and 7.0% of the populations at twofold or higher than average risk for type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease and prostate cancer, respectively. Tripling of sample sizes could elevate these percentages to 18.8%, 6.1% and 12.2%, respectively. The utility of polygenic models for risk prediction will depend on achievable sample sizes for the training data set, the underlying genetic architecture and the inclusion of information on other risk factors, including family history.},

abstract = {Genetic mapping of complex diseases to date depends on variations inside or close to the genes that perturb their activities. A strong body of evidence suggests that changes in gene expression play a key role in complex diseases and that numerous loci perturb gene expression in trans. The information in trans variants, however, has largely been ignored in the current analysis paradigm. Here we present a statistical framework for genetic mapping by utilizing collective information in both cis and trans variants. We reason that for a disease-associated gene, any genetic variation that perturbs its expression is also likely to influence the disease risk. Thus, the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) of the gene, which constitute a unique "genetic signature," should overlap significantly with the set of loci associated with the disease. We translate this idea into a computational algorithm (named Sherlock) to search for gene-disease associations from GWASs, taking advantage of independent eQTL data. Application of this strategy to Crohn disease and type 2 diabetes predicts a number of genes with possible disease roles, including several predictions supported by solid experimental evidence. Importantly, predicted genes are often implicated by multiple trans eQTL with moderate associations. These genes are far from any GWAS association signals and thus cannot be identified from the GWAS alone. Our approach allows analysis of association data from a new perspective and is applicable to any complex phenotype. It is readily generalizable to molecular traits other than gene expression, such as metabolites, noncoding RNAs, and epigenetic modifications.},

abstract = {According to the quality of response they mediate, autoreactive T cells recognizing islet beta cell peptides could represent both disease effectors in the development of type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and directors of tolerance in nondiabetic individuals or those undergoing preventative immunotherapy. A combination of the rarity of these cells, inadequate technology, and poorly defined epitopes, however, has hampered examination of this paradigm. We have identified a panel of naturally processed islet epitopes by direct elution from APCs bearing HLA-DR4. Employing these epitopes in a sensitive, novel cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay, we show that the quality of autoreactive T cells in patients with T1DM exhibits extreme polarization toward a proinflammatory Th1 phenotype. Furthermore, we demonstrate that rather than being unresponsive, the majority of nondiabetic, HLA-matched control subjects also manifest a response against islet peptides, but one that shows extreme T regulatory cell (Treg, IL-10-secreting) bias. We conclude that development of T1DM depends on the balance of autoreactive Th1 and Treg cells, which may be open to favorable manipulation by immune intervention.},

We define the difference in population odds ratios between populations with and without disease misclassification as population-level bias and derive the bias as a function of sensitivity and specificity for observed disease status. The magnitude and direction of bias can be elucidated through analytic derivations, as illustrated with numerical examples.Results. Patterns of bias exist not only for nondifferential misclassification but also for some differential misclassification scenarios. We have provided conditions defined in terms of sensitivity and specificity that correspond to each pattern of bias.Conclusions. Caution is needed in interpreting results when misclassification is present. Our findings can be used to assess the effects of disease misclassification in a population when sensitivity and specificity are known or can be e...},

The analysis of aCGH data sets has revealed the existence of a widespread technical artifact termed as 'waves', characterized by an undulating data profile along the chromosome. Here, we describe the development of a novel noise-reduction algorithm, waves aCGH correction algorithm (WACA), based on GC content and fragment size correction. WACA efficiently removes the wave artifact, thereby greatly improving the accuracy of aCGH data analysis. We describe the application of WACA to both real and simulated aCGH data sets, and demonstrate that our algorithm, by systematically correcting for all known sources of bias, is a significant improvement on existing aCGH noise reduction algorithms. WACA and associated files are freely available as Supplementary Data.},

abstract = {In this survey we overview the definitions and methods for graph clustering, that is, finding sets of ''related'' vertices in graphs. We review the many definitions for what is a cluster in a graph and measures of cluster quality. Then we present global algorithms for producing a clustering for the entire vertex set of an input graph, after which we discuss the task of identifying a cluster for a specific seed vertex by local computation. Some ideas on the application areas of graph clustering algorithms are given. We also address the problematics of evaluating clusterings and benchmarking cluster algorithms.},

abstract = {Persistent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is controlled tightly by virus-specific T cells. EBV infection is reactivated intermittently over time, even in apparently healthy carriers. Changes in frequency and reactivity of memory T cells, particularly of CD8(+) origin, have not been assessed in this context. It is hypothesized that viral reactivation is facilitated by diminished EBV-specific T-cell immunity. To this end, blood samples from 14 healthy donors were collected at irregular time intervals for a period of about 1 year. Samples were screened for both EBV plasma viremia and increases in viral load in PBMCs as parameters of EBV reactivation. PBMCs were subject to IFN-$\gamma$ ELISPOT analysis using the autologous EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (EBV-LCL) or appropriate HLA class I-restricted EBV peptides as stimulators. Frequencies of epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells were monitored further using HLA tetramers and flow cytometry. Twelve of 14 donors exhibited signs of asymptomatic EBV reactivation. Viral reactivation was accompanied by either substantially decreased IFN-$\gamma$ responses against autologous EBV-LCL (eight of 12 study participants) and/or increased responses against particular EBV peptides (six of 12 donors). In seven persons with HLA-A2 and/or -B8 alleles numbers of HLA tetramer-positive CD8(+) T cells also varied over time, but showed no correlation to episodes of detectable viral activity. In summary, IFN-$\gamma$ reactivity of EBV-specific T cells is not constant. Viral reactivation is detected preferably at times of diminished EBV-LCL-specific cellular immunity. However, increased reactivity of single immunodominant CD8(+) EBV-specific T-cell clones may occur in response to virus replication.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION:Flow cytometry (FC) has become increasingly utilized in the diagnosis and monitoring of plasma cell myeloma (PCM), though few studies have evaluated the longitudinal stability of antigen expression.

METHODS:We studied 45 PCM patients by four-color FC for shifts in CD19, CD20, CD38, CD45, CD56, and cytoplasmic light chain expression, between diagnostic/first encounter and positive follow-up analyses. An immunophenotypic (IP) change was defined as gain, loss, or ½ log shift of antigen expression.

RESULTS:An IP change was observed in 14/45 (31%) patients, with single IP changes in 9/14, two changes in 2/14, and three changes in 3/14. 3/14 reverted from an aberrant to a normal plasma cell IP, while remaining light chain-restricted. Changes in expression of CD45 occurred in 9/45 (20%), CD19 in 5/45 (11.1%), CD20 in 2/45 (4.4%), and CD56 in 5/45 (11.1%).

CONCLUSION:Approximately 1/3 of PCM cases show IP changes over time, with CD45 the least stable antigen. Recognition of this relative instability is important to avoid narrow targeting of follow-up FC analyses, especially for minimal residual disease monitoring.},

abstract = {Background: The complex data sets generated by higher-order polychromatic flow cytometry experiments are a challenge to analyze. Here we describe Exhaustive Expansion, a data analysis approach for deriving hundreds to thousands of cell phenotypes from raw data, and for interrogating these phenotypes to identify populations of biological interest given the experimental context.Methods: We apply this approach to two studies, illustrating its broad applicability. The first examines the longitudinal changes in circulating human memory T cell populations within individual patients in response to a melanoma peptide (gp100(209-2M)) cancer vaccine, using 5 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to delineate subpopulations of viable, gp100-specific, CD8+ T cells. The second study measures the mobilization of stem cells in porcine bone marrow that may be associated with wound healing, and uses 5 different staining panels consisting of 8 mAbs each.Results: In the first study, our analysis suggests that the cell surface markers CD45RA, CD27 and CD28, commonly used in historical lower order (2-4 color) flow cytometry analysis to distinguish memory from nave and effector T cells, may not be obligate parameters in defining central memory T cells (T-CM). In the second study, we identify novel phenotypes such as CD29+CD31+CD56+CXCR4+CD90+Sca1-CD44+, which may characterize progenitor cells that are significantly increased in wounded animals as compared to controls.Conclusions: Taken together, these results demonstrate that Exhaustive Expansion supports thorough interrogation of complex higher-order flow cytometry data sets and aids in the identification of potentially clinically relevant findings.},

abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

The SNP array contains all known and genotype-able SNPs across 186 distinct susceptibility loci associated with one or more immune-mediated diseases. After stringent quality control, we analysed 103 875 common SNPs (minor allele frequency >0.05) in 2285 GD and 462 HT patients and 9364 controls. We found evidence for seven new AITD risk loci (P < 1.12 × 10(-6); a permutation test derived significance threshold), five at locations previously associated and two at locations awaiting confirmation, with other immune-mediated diseases.},

abstract = {Recently, comparative genomic hybridization onto bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) arrays (array-based comparative genomic hybridization) has proved to be successful for the detection of submicroscopic DNA copy-number variations in health and disease. Technological improvements to achieve a higher resolution have resulted in the generation of additional microarray platforms encompassing larger numbers of shorter DNA targets (oligonucleotides). Here, we present a novel method to estimate the ability of a microarray to detect genomic copy-number variations of different sizes and types (i.e. deletions or duplications). We applied our method, which is based on statistical power analysis, to four widely used high-density genomic microarray platforms. By doing so, we found that the high-density oligonucleotide platforms are superior to the BAC platform for the genome-wide detection of copy-number variations smaller than 1 Mb. The capacity to reliably detect single copy-number variations below 100 kb, however, appeared to be limited for all platforms tested. In addition, our analysis revealed an unexpected platform-dependent difference in sensitivity to detect a single copy-number loss and a single copy-number gain. These analyses provide a first objective insight into the true capacities and limitations of different genomic microarrays to detect and define DNA copy-number variations.},

abstract = {During the last quarter of the twentieth century, our knowledge about human genetic variation was limited mainly to the heterochromatin polymorphisms, large enough to be visible in the light microscope, and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by traditional PCR-based DNA sequencing. In the past five years, the rapid development and expanded use of microarray technologies, including oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization and SNP genotyping arrays, as well as next-generation sequencing with "paired-end" methods, has enabled a whole-genome analysis with essentially unlimited resolution. The discovery of submicroscopic copy-number variations (CNVs) present in our genomes has changed dramatically our perspective on DNA structural variation and disease. It is now thought that CNVs encompass more total nucleotides and arise more frequently than SNPs. CNVs, to a larger extent than SNPs, have been shown to be responsible for human evolution, genetic diversity between individuals, and a rapidly increasing number of traits or susceptibility to traits; such conditions have been referred to as genomic disorders. In addition to well-known sporadic chromosomal microdeletion syndromes and Mendelian diseases, many common complex traits including autism and schizophrenia can result from CNVs. Both recombination- and replication-based mechanisms for CNV formation have been described.},

Recently there has been a realisation that these SNP platforms can also be used for typing copy number variants (CNVs). This allows for 'generalised' genotyping of both SNPs and CNVs simultaneously on a common sample set, with advantages in terms of cost and unified analysis. In this article we review various statistical approaches to calling CNVs from SNP data. We highlight three tiers of algorithms depending on the level of information used.},

abstract = {Whole-genome microarrays with large-insert clones designed to determine DNA copy number often show variation in hybridization intensity that is related to the genomic position of the clones. We found these 'genomic waves' to be present in Illumina and Affymetrix SNP genotyping arrays, confirming that they are not platform-specific. The causes of genomic waves are not well-understood, and they may prevent accurate inference of copy number variations (CNVs). By measuring DNA concentration for 1444 samples and by genotyping the same sample multiple times with varying DNA quantity, we demonstrated that DNA quantity correlates with the magnitude of waves. We further showed that wavy signal patterns correlate best with GC content, among multiple genomic features considered. To measure the magnitude of waves, we proposed a GC-wave factor (GCWF) measure, which is a reliable predictor of DNA quantity (correlation coefficient = 0.994 based on samples with serial dilution). Finally, we developed a computational approach by fitting regression models with GC content included as a predictor variable, and we show that this approach improves the accuracy of CNV detection. With the wide application of whole-genome SNP genotyping techniques, our wave adjustment method will be important for taking full advantage of genotyped samples for CNV analysis.},

abstract = {Genetic variation at classical HLA alleles is a crucial determinant of transplant success and susceptibility to a large number of infectious and autoimmune diseases. However, large-scale studies involving classical type I and type II HLA alleles might be limited by the cost of allele-typing technologies. Although recent studies have shown that some common HLA alleles can be tagged with small numbers of markers, SNP-based tagging does not offer a complete solution to predicting HLA alleles. We have developed a new statistical methodology to use SNP variation within the region to predict alleles at key class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) and class II (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1) loci. Our results indicate that a single panel of approximately 100 SNPs typed across the region is sufficient for predicting both rare and common HLA alleles with up to 95% accuracy in both African and non-African populations. Furthermore, we show that HLA alleles can be successfully predicted by using previously genotyped SNPs that are within the MHC and that had not been chosen for their ability to predict HLA alleles, such as those included on genome-wide products. These results indicate that our methodology, combined with an extended database of reference haplotypes, will facilitate large-scale experiments, including disease-association studies and vaccine trials, in which detailed information about HLA type is valuable.},

Allotypes differing solely at the Bw4/Bw6 region were examined as were a more divergent subset of B15 allotypes. The capacity to interact with NKB1 correlated precisely with possession of a Bw4 sequence motif at residues 77-83, whereas no correlation was made with the peptide-binding specificities of two Bw4 and four Bw6 allotypes of the B15 family. HLA-B allotypes having four different Bw4 motifs were examined and all interact with NKB1. In contrast, HLA-A allotypes, which have a Bw4 motif identical with one of those present in HLA-B, do not. Mutation at leucine 82 and arginine 83, the residues common to Bw4 motifs, shows they contribute to NKB1 interaction but are not essential. Three types of polymorphism are implicated in formation of the ligand recognized by NKB1: ones shared by Bw4 motifs; ones distinguishing Bw4 motifs; and ones outside the Bw4/Bw6 region that distinguish HLA-B from HLA-A.},

To achieve unambiguous assignments additional unwieldy tests are performed. The American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics formed a committee to define what human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes do not need to be resolved in external proficiency testing. The tasks included detailed analysis of large datasets of high-resolution typing and thorough review of the pertinent scientific literature. Strict criteria were used to create a catalogue of common and well-documented (CWD) alleles. In total, 130, 245, 81, and 143 of the highly polymorphic HLA-A, -B, -C, and DRB1 loci fell into the CWD category; these represent 27%-30% of all alleles recognized. For the loci DRB3/4/5, DQA1, DQB1, and DPB1, a total of 29, 16, 26, and 52 CWD alleles were identified. A recommendation indicated that an acceptable report should only include one possible genotype; multiple genotypes can only be reported if only one of these includes two alleles of the CWD group. Exceptions in which resolution is not necessary are ambiguities involving functional alleles with identical sequences in the antigen recognition site. The criteria were established for proficiency testing, which could be a valuable tool when making clinical histocompatibility decisions.},

abstract = {Allotypes of the natural killer (NK) cell receptor KIR3DL1 vary in both NK cell expression patterns and inhibitory capacity upon binding to their ligands, HLA-B Bw4 molecules, present on target cells. Using a sample size of over 1,500 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)+ individuals, we show that various distinct allelic combinations of the KIR3DL1 and HLA-B loci significantly and strongly influence both AIDS progression and plasma HIV RNA abundance in a consistent manner. These genetic data correlate very well with previously defined functional differences that distinguish KIR3DL1 allotypes. The various epistatic effects observed here for common, distinct KIR3DL1 and HLA-B Bw4 combinations are unprecedented with regard to any pair of genetic loci in human disease, and indicate that NK cells may have a critical role in the natural history of HIV infection.},

We combined these data in a meta-analysis with GWAS data from additional independent cases (n = 2,363) and controls (n = 17,872). We identified 14 new susceptibility loci, 9 of which were associated with rheumatoid arthritis overall and five of which were specifically associated with disease that was positive for anticitrullinated peptide antibodies, bringing the number of confirmed rheumatoid arthritis risk loci in individuals of European ancestry to 46. We refined the peak of association to a single gene for 19 loci, identified secondary independent effects at 6 loci and identified association to low-frequency variants at 4 loci. Bioinformatic analyses generated strong hypotheses for the causal SNP at seven loci. This study illustrates the advantages of dense SNP mapping analysis to inform subsequent functional investigations.},

abstract = {Most genome-wide association studies to date have been performed in populations of European descent, but there is increasing interest in expanding these studies to other populations. The performance of genotyping chips in Asian populations is not well established. Therefore, we sought to test the performance of widely used fixed-marker, genome-wide association studies chips in the Han Chinese population. Non-HapMap Chinese samples (n = 396) were genotyped using the Illumina OmniExpress and Affymetrix 6.0 platforms, whereas a subset also were genotyped using the Immunochip. Genotyped markers from the Affymetrix 6.0 and Illumina OmniExpress were used for full genome imputation based on the HapMap 2 JPT+CHB (Japanese from Tokyo, Japan and Chinese from Beijing, China) reference panel. The concordance between markers genotypes for the three platforms was very high whether directly genotyped or genotyped and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; >99.8% for directly genotyped and >99.5% for genotyped and imputed SNPs, respectively) were compared. The OmniExpress chip data enabled more SNPs to be imputed, particularly SNPs with minor allele frequency >5%. The OmniExpress chip achieved better coverage of HapMap SNPs than the Affymetrix 6.0 chip (73.6% vs. 65.9%, respectively, for minor allele frequency >5%). The Affymetrix 6.0 and Illumina OmniExpress chip have similar genotyping accuracy and provide similar accuracy of imputed SNPs. The OmniExpress chip however provides better coverage of Asian HapMap SNPs, although its coverage of HapMap SNPs is moderate.},

abstract = {The analysis of whole blood samples by flow cytometry for pharmacodynamic and biomarker assessments in clinical studies has been limited by the necessity to test these samples within a short time frame after blood collection. In most clinical studies, blood specimens are shipped to a centralized testing facility; it is critical to demonstrate specimen stability over a period of time which will encompass the time elapsed between specimen collection and testing. A possible solution to overcome this limitation is the use of a fixative to preserve the cell surface antigen stability in whole blood. We examined the stability of markers for T lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RA, and CD45RO), B lymphocytes (CD19), NK cells (CD16+CD56), activation (CD25 and HLA-DR), chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CXCR3) and skin homing (CLA) in fixed blood over 7 days and used this information to select the markers for global clinical studies. These assays with selected markers were further validated using fit-for-purpose approach (Lee et al., 2006) and to set the sample acceptability criteria for use in clinical sample testing. Most of the markers examined were stable when collected in Cyto-Chex{\textregistered} BCT for one week with the exception of the activation markers on T cells.},

The first of many analytical challenges in these studies involves the choice of SNPs to genotype. It is not practical to construct a different panel of tag SNPs for each study, so the first generation of genome-wide scans will use predefined, commercially available marker panels, which will in part dictate their success or failure. We compare different approaches in use today, and show that although many of them provide substantial coverage of common variation in non-African populations, the precise extent is strongly dependent on the frequencies of alleles of interest and on specific considerations of study design. Overall, despite substantial differences in genotyping technologies, marker selection strategies and number of markers assayed, the first-generation high-throughput platforms all offer similar levels of genome coverage.},

We compared the immunophenotypes at diagnosis and relapse in 51 childhood and adult B-ALLs with flow cytometry (FC) using broad antibody panels. A total of 446 aberrancies were present at diagnosis (median, 9 per case; range, 2-14). All cases retained multiple aberrancies at relapse (median, 8 per case; range, 2-14). Antibody panels at relapse allowed assessment of 383 (85.9%) of the initial 446 aberrancies. Of these, 299 (78.1%) were persistent and 84 (21.9%) were lost at relapse. Overall, 73% of cases showed a loss of at least 1 aberrancy at relapse. However, new aberrancies were detected in 60% of cases. These findings suggest that FC is suitable for the detection of residual B-ALL, provided that follow-up studies are not too narrowly targeted.},

abstract = {To fully understand the allelic variation that underlies common diseases, complete genome sequencing for many individuals with and without disease is required. This is still not technically feasible. However, recently it has become possible to carry out partial surveys of the genome by genotyping large numbers of common SNPs in genome-wide association studies. Here, we outline the main factors - including models of the allelic architecture of common diseases, sample size, map density and sample-collection biases - that need to be taken into account in order to optimize the cost efficiency of identifying genuine disease-susceptibility loci.},

abstract = {SNP genotyping has emerged as a technology to incorporate copy number variants (CNVs) into genetic analyses of human traits. However, the extent to which SNP platforms accurately capture CNVs remains unclear. Using independent, sequence-based CNV maps, we find that commonly used SNP platforms have limited or no probe coverage for a large fraction of CNVs. Despite this, in 9 samples we inferred 368 CNVs using Illumina SNP genotyping data and experimentally validated over two-thirds of these. We also developed a method (SNP-Conditional Mixture Modeling, SCIMM) to robustly genotype deletions using as few as two SNP probes. We find that HapMap SNPs are strongly correlated with 82% of common deletions, but the newest SNP platforms effectively tag about 50%. We conclude that currently available genome-wide SNP assays can capture CNVs accurately, but improvements in array designs, particularly in duplicated sequences, are necessary to facilitate more comprehensive analyses of genomic variation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules bind, and present to T cells, short peptides derived from intracellular processing of proteins. The peptide repertoire of a specific molecule is to a large extent determined by the molecular structure accommodating so-called main anchor positions of the presented peptide. These receptors are extremely polymorphic, and much of the polymorphism influences the peptide-binding repertoire. However, despite this polymorphism, class I molecules can be clustered into sets of molecules that bind largely overlapping peptide repertoires. Almost a decade ago we introduced this concept of clustering human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and defined nine different groups, denominated as supertypes, on the basis of their main anchor specificity. The utility of this original supertype classification, as well several other subsequent arrangements derived by others, has been demonstrated in a large number of epitope identification studies.

RESULTS:Following our original approach, in the present report we provide an updated classification of HLA-A and -B class I alleles into supertypes. The present analysis incorporates the large amount of class I MHC binding data and sequence information that has become available in the last decade. As a result, over 80% of the 945 different HLA-A and -B alleles examined to date can be assigned to one of the original nine supertypes. A few alleles are expected to be associated with repertoires that overlap multiple supertypes. Interestingly, the current analysis did not identify any additional supertype specificities.

CONCLUSION:As a result of this updated analysis, HLA supertype associations have been defined for over 750 different HLA-A and -B alleles. This information is expected to facilitate epitope identification and vaccine design studies, as well as investigations into disease association and correlates of immunity. In addition, the approach utilized has been made more transparent, allowing others to utilize the classification approach going forward.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) or intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) can quantitate antigen-specific T cell responses in settings such as experimental vaccination. Standardization of ICS among laboratories performing vaccine studies would provide a common platform by which to compare the immunogenicity of different vaccine candidates across multiple international organizations conducting clinical trials. As such, a study was carried out among several laboratories involved in HIV clinical trials, to define the inter-lab precision of ICS using various sample types, and using a common protocol for each experiment (see additional files online).

RESULTS:Three sample types (activated, fixed, and frozen whole blood; fresh whole blood; and cryopreserved PBMC) were shipped to various sites, where ICS assays using cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 peptide mix or control antigens were performed in parallel in 96-well plates. For one experiment, antigens and antibody cocktails were lyophilised into 96-well plates to simplify and standardize the assay setup. Results ((CD4+)cytokine+ cells and (CD8+)cytokine+ cells) were determined by each site. Raw data were also sent to a central site for batch analysis with a dynamic gating template. Mean inter-laboratory coefficient of variation (C.V.) ranged from 17-44% depending upon the sample type and analysis method. Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) yielded lower inter-lab C.V.'s than whole blood. Centralized analysis (using a dynamic gating template) reduced the inter-lab C.V. by 5-20%, depending upon the experiment. The inter-lab C.V. was lowest (18-24%) for samples with a mean of > 0.5% IFNgamma + T cells, and highest (57-82%) for samples with a mean of < 0.1% IFNgamma + cells.

CONCLUSION:ICS assays can be performed by multiple laboratories using a common protocol with good inter-laboratory precision, which improves as the frequency of responding cells increases. Cryopreserved PBMC may yield slightly more consistent results than shipped whole blood. Analysis, particularly gating, is a significant source of variability, and can be reduced by centralized analysis and/or use of a standardized dynamic gating template. Use of pre-aliquoted lyophilized reagents for stimulation and staining can provide further standardization to these assays.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of associated loci across many common diseases. Most risk variants identified by GWAS will merely be tags for as-yet-unknown causal variants. It is therefore possible that identification of the causal variant, by fine mapping, will identify alleles with larger effects on genetic risk than those currently estimated from GWAS replication studies. We show that under plausible assumptions, whilst the majority of the per-allele relative risks (RR) estimated from GWAS data will be close to the true risk at the causal variant, some could be considerable underestimates. For example, for an estimated RR in the range 1.2-1.3, there is approximately a 38% chance that it exceeds 1.4 and a 10% chance that it is over 2. We show how these probabilities can vary depending on the true effects associated with low-frequency variants and on the minor allele frequency (MAF) of the most associated SNP. We investigate the consequences of the underestimation of effect sizes for predictions of an individual's disease risk and interpret our results for the design of fine mapping experiments. Although these effects mean that the amount of heritability explained by known GWAS loci is expected to be larger than current projections, this increase is likely to explain a relatively small amount of the so-called "missing" heritability.},

abstract = {In the past few years genome-wide association (GWA) studies have uncovered a large number of convincingly replicated associations for many complex human diseases. Genotype imputation has been used widely in the analysis of GWA studies to boost power, fine-map associations and facilitate the combination of results across studies using meta-analysis. This Review describes the details of several different statistical methods for imputing genotypes, illustrates and discusses the factors that influence imputation performance, and reviews methods that can be used to assess imputation performance and test association at imputed SNPs.},

An outstanding question is how to use these technologies efficiently to identify genes affecting liability to complex disorders. To achieve this goal, we propose a statistical method that has several optimal properties: It can be used with case control data and yet, like family-based designs, controls for population heterogeneity; it is insensitive to the usual violations of model assumptions, such as cases failing to be strictly independent; and, by using Bayesian outlier methods, it circumvents the need for Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, leading to better performance in many settings while still constraining risk for false positives. The performance of our genomic control method is quite good for plausible effects of liability genes, which bodes well for future genetic analyses of complex disorders.},

abstract = {Statistical mixture modeling provides an opportunity for automated identification and resolution of cell subtypes in flow cytometric data. The configuration of cells as represented by multiple markers simultaneously can be modeled arbitrarily well as a mixture of Gaussian distributions in the dimension of the number of markers. Cellular subtypes may be related to one or multiple components of such mixtures, and fitted mixture models can be evaluated in the full set of markers as an alternative, or adjunct, to traditional subjective gating methods that rely on choosing one or two dimensions. Four color flow data from human blood cells labeled with FITC-conjugated anti-CD3, PE-conjugated anti-CD8, PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD4, and APC-conjugated anti-CD19 Abs was acquired on a FACSCalibur. Cells from four murine cell lines, JAWS 11, RAW 264.7, CTLL-2, and A20, were also stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD11c, PE-conjugated anti-CD11b, PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD8a, and PE-Cy7-conjugated-CD45R/B220 Abs, respectively, and single color flow data were collected on an LSRII. The data were fitted with a mixture of multivariate Gaussians using standard Bayesian statistical approaches and Markov chain Monte Carlo computations. Statistical mixture models were able to identify and purify major cell subsets in human peripheral blood, using an automated process that can be generalized to an arbitrary number of markers. Validation against both traditional expert gating and synthetic mixtures of murine cell lines with known mixing proportions was also performed. This article describes the studies of statistical mixture modeling of flow cytometric data, and demonstrates their utility in examples with four-color flow data from human peripheral blood samples and synthetic mixtures of murine cell lines.

The developments are partly motivated by computational challenges arising in fitting models of increasing heterogeneity to increasingly large datasets. An example context concerns common biological studies using high-throughput technologies generating many, very large datasets and requiring increasingly high-dimensional mixture models with large numbers of mixture components. We outline important strategies and processes for CPU computation in Bayesian simulation and optimization approaches, give examples of the benefits of CPU implementations in terms of processing speed and scale-up in ability to analyze large datasets, and provide a detailed, tutorial-style exposition that will benefit readers interested in developing CPU-based approaches in other statistical models. Novel, CPU-oriented approaches to modifying existing algorithms software design can lead to vast speed-up and, critically, enable statistical analyses that presently will not be performed due to compute time limitations in traditional computational environments. Supplemental materials are provided with all source code, example data, and details that will enable readers to implement and explore the CPU approach in this mixture modeling context.},

abstract = {Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) by multiparameter flow cytometry is one of the primary methods for determining T-cell immunogenicity in HIV-1 clinical vaccine trials. Data analysis requires considerable expertise and time. The amount of data is quickly increasing as more and larger trials are performed, and thus there is a critical need for high-throughput methods of data analysis. A web-based flow cytometric analysis system, LabKey Flow, was developed for the analyses of data from standardized ICS assays. Using a gating template created manually in commercially available flow cytometric analysis software, the system automatically compensates and analyzes all data sets. Quality control queries were designed to identify potentially incorrect sample collections. Comparison of the semiautomated analysis performed by LabKey Flow and the manual analysis performed using FlowJo software demonstrated excellent concordance (concordance correlation coefficient > 0.990). Manual inspection of the analyses performed by LabKey Flow for eight-color ICS data files from several clinical vaccine trials indicated that template gates can appropriately be used for most data sets. Thus, the semiautomated LabKey Flow analysis system can accurately analyze large ICS data files. Routine use of the system does not require specialized expertise. This high-throughput analysis will provide great utility for rapid evaluation of complex multiparameter flow cytometric measurements collected from large clinical trials.},

abstract = {Flow Cytometry has become a mainstay technique for measuring fluorescent and physical attributes of single cells in a suspended mixture. These data are reduced during analysis using a manual or semiautomated process of gating. Despite the need to gate data for traditional analyses, it is well recognized that analyst-to-analyst variability can impact the dataset. Moreover, cells of interest can be inadvertently excluded from the gate, and relationships between collected variables may go unappreciated because they were not included in the original analysis plan. A multivariate non-gating technique was developed and implemented that accomplished the same goal as traditional gating while eliminating many weaknesses. The procedure was validated against traditional gating for analysis of circulating B cells in normal donors (n = 20) and persons with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (n = 42). The method recapitulated relationships in the dataset while providing for an automated and objective assessment of the data. Flow cytometry analyses are amenable to automated analytical techniques that are not predicated on discrete operator-generated gates. Such alternative approaches can remove subjectivity in data analysis, improve efficiency and may ultimately enable construction of large bioinformatics data systems for more sophisticated approaches to hypothesis testing.},

abstract = {This practical introduction helps readers apply multilevel techniques to their research. Noted as an accessible introduction, the book also includes advanced extensions, making it useful as both an introduction and as a reference to students, researchers, and methodologists. Basic models and examples are discussed in non-technical terms with an emphasis on understanding the methodological and statistical issues involved in using these models. The estimation and interpretation of multilevel models is demonstrated using realistic examples from various disciplines. For example, readers will find data sets on stress in hospitals, GPA scores, survey responses, street safety, epilepsy, divorce, and sociometric scores, to name a few. The data sets are available on the website in SPSS, HLM, MLwiN, LISREL and/or Mplus files. Readers are introduced to both the multilevel regression model and multilevel structural models. Highlights of the second edition include: Two new chapters---one on multilevel models for ordinal and count data (Ch. 7) and another on multilevel survival analysis (Ch. 8). Thoroughly updated chapters on multilevel structural equation modeling that reflect the enormous technical progress of the last few years. The addition of some simpler examples to help the novice, whilst the more complex examples that combine more than one problem have been retained. A new section on multivariate meta-analysis (Ch. 11). Expanded discussions of covariance structures across time and analyzing longitudinal data where no trend is expected. Expanded chapter on the logistic model for dichotomous data and proportions with new estimation methods. An updated website at http://www.joophox.net/ with data sets for all the text examples and up-to-date screen shots and PowerPoint slides for instructors. Ideal for introductory courses on multilevel modeling and/or ones that introduce this topic in some detail taught in a variety of disciplines including: psychology, education, sociology, the health sciences, and business. The advanced extensions also make this a favorite resource for researchers and methodologists in these disciplines. A basic understanding of ANOVA and multiple regression is assumed. The section on multilevel structural equation models assumes a basic understanding of SEM.},

abstract = {An important paradigm in evolutionary genetics is that of a delicate balance between genetic variants that favorably boost host control of infection but which may unfavorably increase susceptibility to autoimmune disease. Here, we investigated whether patients with psoriasis, a common immune-mediated disease of the skin, are enriched for genetic variants that limit the ability of HIV-1 virus to replicate after infection. We analyzed the HLA class I and class II alleles of 1,727 Caucasian psoriasis cases and 3,581 controls and found that psoriasis patients are significantly more likely than controls to have gene variants that are protective against HIV-1 disease. This includes several HLA class I alleles associated with HIV-1 control; amino acid residues at HLA-B positions 67, 70, and 97 that mediate HIV-1 peptide binding; and the deletion polymorphism rs67384697 associated with high surface expression of HLA-C. We also found that the compound genotype KIR3DS1 plus HLA-B Bw4-80I, which respectively encode a natural killer cell activating receptor and its putative ligand, significantly increased psoriasis susceptibility. This compound genotype has also been associated with delay of progression to AIDS. Together, our results suggest that genetic variants that contribute to anti-viral immunity may predispose to the development of psoriasis.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract Over the past few years there has been growing interest in considering factors defined at multiple levels in public health research. Multilevel analysis has emerged as one analytical strategy that may partly address this need, by allowing the simultaneous examination of group-level and individual-level factors. This paper reviews the rationale for using multilevel analysis in public health research, summarizes the statistical methodology, and highlights some of the research questions that have been addressed using these methods. The advantages and disadvantages of multi level analysis compared with standard methods are reviewed. The use of multilevel analysis raises theoretical and methodological issues related to the theoretical model being tested, the conceptual distinction between group and individual-level variables, the ability to differentiate ``independent'' effects, the reciprocal relationships between factors at different levels, and the increased complexity that these models imply.

Unfortunately, in complex problems (e.g., split-plot designs), it is not always easy to set up an appropriate ANOVA. We propose a hierarchical analysis that automatically gives the correct ANOVA comparisons even in complex scenarios. The inferences for all means and variances are performed under a model with a separate batch of effects for each row of the ANOVA table. We connect to classical ANOVA by working with finite-sample variance components: fixed and random effects models are characterized by inferences about existing levels of a factor and new levels, respectively. We also introduce a new graphical display showing inferences about the standard deviations of each batch of effects. We illustrate with two examples from our applied data analysis, first illustrating the usefulness of our hierarchical computations and displays, and second showing how the ideas of ANOVA are helpful in understanding a previously fit hierarchical model.},

abstract = {Ultra-high-throughput sequencing is emerging as an attractive alternative to microarrays for genotyping, analysis of methylation patterns, and identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here, we describe an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) platform to study mRNA expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying loci contributing effects to a range of complex human traits. The majority of reproducible associations within these loci are with common variants, each of modest effect, which together explain only a small proportion of heritability. It has been suggested that much of the unexplained genetic component of complex traits can thus be attributed to rare variation. However, genome-wide association study genotyping chips have been designed primarily to capture common variation, and thus are underpowered to detect the effects of rare variants. Nevertheless, we demonstrate here, by simulation, that imputation from an existing scaffold of genome-wide genotype data up to high-density reference panels has the potential to identify rare variant associations with complex traits, without the need for costly re-sequencing experiments. By application of this approach to genome-wide association studies of seven common complex diseases, imputed up to publicly available reference panels, we identify genome-wide significant evidence of rare variant association in PRDM10 with coronary artery disease and multiple genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with type 1 diabetes. The results of our analyses highlight that genome-wide association studies have the potential to offer an exciting opportunity for gene discovery through association with rare variants, conceivably leading to substantial advancements in our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying complex human traits.},

abstract = {Although association analysis is a useful tool for uncovering the genetic underpinnings of complex traits, its utility is diminished by population substructure, which can produce spurious association between phenotype and genotype within population-based samples. Because family-based designs are robust against substructure, they have risen to the fore of association analysis. Yet, if population substructure could be ignored, this robustness can come at the price of power. Unfortunately it is rarely evident when population substructure can be ignored. Devlin and Roeder recently have proposed a method, termed "genomic control" (GC), which has the robustness of family-based designs even though it uses population-based data. GC uses the genome itself to determine appropriate corrections for population-based association tests. Using the GC method, we contrast the power of two study designs, family trios (i.e., father, mother, and affected progeny) versus case-control. For analysis of trios, we use the TDT test. When population substructure is absent, we find GC is always more powerful than TDT; furthermore, contrary to previous results, we show that as a disease becomes more prevalent the discrepancy in power becomes more extreme. When population substructure is present, however, the results are more complex: TDT is more powerful when population substructure is substantial, and GC is more powerful otherwise. We also explore general issues of power and implementation of GC within the case-control setting and find that, economically, CC is at least comparable to and often less expensive than family-based methods. Therefore, CC methods should prove a useful complement to family-based methods for the genetic analysis of complex traits.},

abstract = {During the past decade, mutations affecting liability to human disease have been discovered at a phenomenal rate, and that rate is increasing. For the most part, however, those diseases have a relatively simple genetic basis. For diseases with a complex genetic and environmental basis, new approaches are needed to pave the way for more rapid discovery of genes affecting liability. One such approach exploits large, population-based samples and large-scale genotyping to evaluate disease/gene associations. A substantial drawback to such samples is the fact that population heterogeneity can induce spurious associations between genes and disease. We describe a method called genomic control (GC), which obviates many of the concerns about population substructure by using the features of the genomes present in the sample to correct for stratification. Two such approaches are now available. The GC approach exploits the fact that population substructure generate "overdispersion" of statistics used to assess association. By testing multiple polymorphisms throughout the genome, only some of which are pertinent to the disease of interest, the degree of overdispersion generated by population substructure can be estimated and taken into account. The other approach, called Structured Association (SA), assumes that the sampled population, while heterogeneous, is composed of subpopulations that are themselves homogeneous. By using multiple polymorphisms throughout the genome, SA probabilistically assigns sampled individuals to these latent subpopulations. We review in detail the overdispersion GC. In addition to outlining the published ideas on this method, we describe several extensions: quantitative trait studies and case-control studies with haplotypes and multiallelic markers. For each study design our goal is to achieve control similar to that obtained for a family-based study, but with the convenience found in a population-based design.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Large-scale high throughput studies using microarray technology have established that copy number variation (CNV) throughout the genome is more frequent than previously thought. Such variation is known to play an important role in the presence and development of phenotypes such as HIV-1 infection and Alzheimer's disease. However, methods for analyzing the complex data produced and identifying regions of CNV are still being refined.

RESULTS:We describe the presence of a genome-wide technical artifact, spatial autocorrelation or 'wave', which occurs in a large dataset used to determine the location of CNV across the genome. By removing this artifact we are able to obtain both a more biologically meaningful clustering of the data and an increase in the number of CNVs identified by current calling methods without a major increase in the number of false positives detected. Moreover, removing this artifact is critical for the development of a novel model-based CNV calling algorithm - CNVmix - that uses cross-sample information to identify regions of the genome where CNVs occur. For regions of CNV that are identified by both CNVmix and current methods, we demonstrate that CNVmix is better able to categorize samples into groups that represent copy number gains or losses.

CONCLUSION:Removing artifactual 'waves' (which appear to be a general feature of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) datasets) and using cross-sample information when identifying CNVs enables more biological information to be extracted from aCGH experiments designed to investigate copy number variation in normal individuals.},

abstract = {Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying natural variation in gene expression is a central goal of both medical and evolutionary genetics, and studies of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have become an important tool for achieving this goal(1). Although all eQTL studies so far have assayed messenger RNA levels using expression microarrays, recent advances in RNA sequencing enable the analysis of transcript variation at unprecedented resolution. We sequenced RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by the International HapMap Project(2). By pooling data from all individuals, we generated a map of the transcriptional landscape of these cells, identifying extensive use of unannotated untranslated regions and more than 100 new putative protein-coding exons. Using the genotypes from the HapMap project, we identified more than a thousand genes at which genetic variation influences overall expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that eQTLs near genes generally act by a mechanism involving allele-specific expression, and that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is enriched within and near the consensus splice sites. Our results illustrate the power of high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of variation in transcription, splicing and allele-specific expression across individuals.},

abstract = {Array-CGH is a powerful tool for the detection of chromosomal aberrations. The introduction of high-density SNP genotyping technology to genomic profiling, termed SNP-CGH, represents a further advance, since simultaneous measurement of both signal intensity variations and changes in allelic composition makes it possible to detect both copy number changes and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events. We demonstrate the utility of SNP-CGH with two Infinium whole-genome genotyping BeadChips, assaying 109,000 and 317,000 SNP loci, to detect chromosomal aberrations in samples bearing constitutional aberrations as well tumor samples at sub-100 kb effective resolution. Detected aberrations include homozygous deletions, hemizygous deletions, copy-neutral LOH, duplications, and amplifications. The statistical ability to detect common aberrations was modeled by analysis of an X chromosome titration model system, and sensitivity was modeled by titration of gDNA from a tumor cell with that of its paired normal cell line. Analysis was facilitated by using a genome browser that plots log ratios of normalized intensities and allelic ratios along the chromosomes. We developed two modes of SNP-CGH analysis, a single sample and a paired sample mode. The single sample mode computes log intensity ratios and allelic ratios by referencing to canonical genotype clusters generated from approximately 120 reference samples, whereas the paired sample mode uses a paired normal reference sample from the same individual. Finally, the two analysis modes are compared and contrasted for their utility in analyzing different types of input gDNA: low input amounts, fragmented gDNA, and Phi29 whole-genome pre-amplified DNA.},

The file may contain one or more data sets. Each data set includes data from a single sample or acquisition run. Each data set consists of a minimum of four parts--HEADER, TEXT, DATA, and ANALYSIS--all of which are required. The file is structured such that the parts of a data set do not have to be in any particular order, except for the HEADER, which must always be first. The HEADER contains pointers to the beginning and end of each of the other three parts. The file is written as a continuous byte stream, with no line or page formating. The HEADER, TEXT, and ANALYSIS parts are written in ASCII format and the DATA part can be written in ASCII, binary integer or floating point. This Standard, noted as FCS2.0, is based on a standard proposed by Murphy and Chused (Cytometry 5:553-555, 1984). Data written utilizing their proposed format (FCS1.0) is compatible with the format described here. Future versions of the standard will maintain compatibility with older versions.},

abstract = {The function of NK cells is controlled by several activating and inhibitory receptors, including the family of Killer-immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). The KIR gene 3DS1 (KIR3DS1) represents a conserved allelic variant of the KIR3DL1/S1 gene locus. 3DS1 belongs to the KIR haplotype group B along with other KIR genes encoding for activating KIRs and is present in all human populations. The encoded gene product KIR3DS1 exhibits three extracellular domains, a short cytoplasmic tail and a trans-membrane domain containing a positively charged residue. The latter allows recruitment of the ITAM-bearing adaptor molecule, DAP12, and thus conferring the activating quality to KIR3DS1. Although interaction with its putative ligand HLA-Bw4-I80 or any other HLA class I subtype has not been demonstrated to date, a growing number of associations between the presence of 3DS1 and the outcome of viral infections have been described. Especially, the protective role of KIR3DS1 in combination with HLA-Bw4-I80 in the context of progressive HIV infection has been studied intensively. In addition, a number of recent studies associated the presence or absence of KIR3DS1 with the occurrence and outcome of several malignancies, as well as of autoimmune diseases and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In this review, the present knowledge regarding the role of KIRD3S1 in various diseases will be summarized. },

abstract = {Human CD3-16+56+ natural killer (NK) cells have been shown to display a clonally distributed ability to recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I alleles. Opposite to T lymphocytes, in NK cells, specific recognition of MHC class I molecules appears to induce inhibition of cytolytic activity and, thus, to protect target cells. Since a precise correlation has been established between the expression of the NK-specific GL183 and EB6 surface molecules (belonging to the novel p58 molecular family) and the specificity of NK clones, we analyzed whether p58 molecules could function as receptors for MHC in human NK cells. NK clones displaying the previously defined "specificity 2" and characterized by the GL183+EB6+ phenotype, specifically recognize the Cw3 allele and thus fail to lyse the Fc gamma R+ P815 target cells transfected with Cw3. On the other hand, NK clones displaying "specificity 1" and expressing the GL183-EB6+ phenotype failed to lyse Cw4+ target cells. Addition of the F(ab')2 fragments of either GL183 or EB6 mAb as well as the XA141 mAb of IgM isotype (specific for the EB6 molecules) completely restored the lysis of Cw3-transfected P815 cells by the Cw3-specific NK clones EX2 and EX4. Similarly, both the entire EB6 mAb, its F(ab')2 fragment and the XA141 mAb reconstituted the lysis of C1R, a Fc gamma R- target cell expressing Cw4 as the only serologically detected class I antigen. Thus, it appears that masking of different members of p58 molecules prevents recognition of "protective" MHC class I alleles and thus the delivering of inhibitory signals. Further support to the concept that p58 molecules represent a NK receptor delivering a negative signal was provided by experiments in which the entire anti-p58 mAbs (of IgG isotype) could inhibit the lysis of unprotected Fc gamma R+ P815 target cells, thus mimicking the inhibitory effect of MHC class I molecules.},

In the next stage, these analytes were developed as a refined 51-plex immunoassay panel for validation using a large independent cohort of schizophrenia (n = 577) and control (n = 229) subjects. The resulting test yielded an overall sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 83% with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) of 89%. These 51 immunoassays and the associated decision rule delivered a sensitive and specific prediction for the presence of schizophrenia in patients compared to matched healthy controls.},

Both innate and adaptive immune responses participate in disease pathogenesis. Studies in animal models and in man have shown that NK cells are involved both in disease progression and in disease protection, thus suggesting that NK cells can represent a potential therapeutic target in type 1 diabetes, once the contribution of these cells to islet autoimmunity has been fully elucidated.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in their search for common genetic variants associated with complex traits and diseases. With new advances in array technologies together with available genetic reference sets, the next generation of GWAS will extend the search for associations with uncommon SNPs (1% ≤ MAF ≤ 10%). Two possible approaches are genotyping all participants, a prohibitively expensive option for large GWAS, or using a combination of genotyping and imputation. Here, we consider a two platform method that genotypes all participants on a standard genotyping array, designed to identify common variants, and then supplements that data by genotyping only a small proportion of the participants on a platform that has higher coverage for uncommon SNPs. This subset of the study population is then included as part of the imputation reference set. To demonstrate the use of this two-platform design, we evaluate its potential efficiency using a newly available dataset containing 756 individuals genotyped on both the Illumina Human OmniExpress and Omni2.5 Quad. Although genotyping all individuals on the denser array would be ideal, we find that genotyping only 100 individuals on this array, in combination with imputation, leads to only a modest loss of power for detecting associations. However, the loss of power due to imputation can be more substantial if the relative risks for rare variants are significantly larger than those previously observed for common variants.},

abstract = {Over the past several years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have succeeded in identifying hundreds of genetic markers associated with common diseases. However, most of these markers confer relatively small increments of risk and explain only a small proportion of familial clustering. To identify obstacles to future progress in genetic epidemiology research and provide recommendations to NIH for overcoming these barriers, the National Cancer Institute sponsored a workshop entitled "Next Generation Analytic Tools for Large-Scale Genetic Epidemiology Studies of Complex Diseases" on September 15-16, 2010. The goal of the workshop was to facilitate discussions on (1) statistical strategies and methods to efficiently identify genetic and environmental factors contributing to the risk of complex disease; and (2) how to develop, apply, and evaluate these strategies for the design, analysis, and interpretation of large-scale complex disease association studies in order to guide NIH in setting the future agenda in this area of research. The workshop was organized as a series of short presentations covering scientific (gene-gene and gene-environment interaction, complex phenotypes, and rare variants and next generation sequencing) and methodological (simulation modeling and computational resources and data management) topic areas. Specific needs to advance the field were identified during each session and are summarized.},

abstract = {The increasing complexity of multiparameter data collection and analysis in flow cytometry and the development of relatively inexpensive arc-lamp-based flow cytometers, which increases the probability that laboratories or institutions may have more than one type of instrument, creates a need for shareable analysis programs and for the transport of flow cytometric data files within an installation or from one institution to another. To address this need, we propose a standard file format to be used for all flow cytometric data. The general principles of this proposal are: (1) The data file will contain a minimum of three segments, TEXT, DATA, and ANALYSIS; (2) The TEXT and ANALYSIS segments consist of KEYWORDS, which are the names of data fields, and their values; (3) All TEXT is encoded in ASCII; (4) KEYWORDS and their values may be of any length; (5) Certain KEYWORDS will be standard, i.e., having specified formats to be recognized by all programs. The structure of the DATA segment will be uniquely defined by the values of KEYWORDS in the TEXT area. It may be in any bit resolution, facilitating compatibility between machines with different word length and/or allowing bit compression of the data. The structured nature of the TEXT area should facilitate management of flow cytometric data using existing data base management systems. The proposed file format has been implemented on VAX, PDP-11, and HP9920 based flow cytometry data acquisition systems.},

abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

The extensive variability observed in genes and alleles related to the immune system response and its significance in transplantation, disease association studies and diversity in populations led to the development of this electronic resource. At present, the system contains data from 1133 populations in 608,813 individuals on the frequency of genes from different polymorphic regions such as human leukocyte antigens, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors, major histocompatibility complex Class I chain-related genes and a number of cytokine gene polymorphisms. The project was designed to create a central source for the storage of frequency data and provide individuals with a set of bioinformatics tools to analyze the occurrence of these variants in worldwide populations. The resource has been used in a wide variety of contexts, including clinical applications (histocompatibility, immunology, epidemiology and pharmacogenetics) and population genetics. Demographic information, frequency data and searching tools can be freely accessed through the website.},

abstract = {Increasing knowledge about the organization of proteins into complexes, systems, and pathways has led to a flowering of theoretical approaches for exploiting this knowledge in order to better learn the functions of proteins and their roles underlying phenotypic traits and diseases. Much of this body of theory has been developed and tested in model organisms, relying on their relative simplicity and genetic and biochemical tractability to accelerate the research. In this review, we discuss several of the major approaches for computationally integrating proteomics and genomics observations into integrated protein networks, then applying guilt-by-association in these networks in order to identify genes underlying traits. Recent trends in this field include a rising appreciation of the modular network organization of proteins underlying traits or mutational phenotypes, and how to exploit such protein modularity using computational approaches related to the internet search algorithm PageRank. Many protein network-based predictions have recently been experimentally confirmed in yeast, worms, plants, and mice, and several successful approaches in model organisms have been directly translated to analyze human disease, with notable recent applications to glioma and breast cancer prognosis.

abstract = {A global analysis of 2,709 published interactions between proteins of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been performed, enabling the establishment of a single large network of 2,358 interactions among 1,548 proteins. Proteins of known function and cellular location tend to cluster together, with 63% of the interactions occurring between proteins with a common functional assignment and 76% occurring between proteins found in the same subcellular compartment. Possible functions can be assigned to a protein based on the known functions of its interacting partners. This approach correctly predicts a functional category for 72% of the 1,393 characterized proteins with at least one partner of known function, and has been applied to predict functions for 364 previously uncharacterized proteins.},

abstract = {Network "guilt by association" (GBA) is a proven approach for identifying novel disease genes based on the observation that similar mutational phenotypes arise from functionally related genes. In principle, this approach could account even for nonadditive genetic interactions, which underlie the synergistic combinations of mutations often linked to complex diseases. Here, we analyze a large-scale, human gene functional interaction network (dubbed HumanNet). We show that candidate disease genes can be effectively identified by GBA in cross-validated tests using label propagation algorithms related to Google's PageRank. However, GBA has been shown to work poorly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), where many genes are somewhat implicated, but few are known with very high certainty. Here, we resolve this by explicitly modeling the uncertainty of the associations and incorporating the uncertainty for the seed set into the GBA framework. We observe a significant boost in the power to detect validated candidate genes for Crohn's disease and type 2 diabetes by comparing our predictions to results from follow-up meta-analyses, with incorporation of the network serving to highlight the JAK-STAT pathway and associated adaptors GRB2/SHC1 in Crohn's disease and BACH2 in type 2 diabetes. Consideration of the network during GWAS thus conveys some of the benefits of enrolling more participants in the GWAS study. More generally, we demonstrate that a functional network of human genes provides a valuable statistical framework for prioritizing candidate disease genes, both for candidate gene-based and GWAS-based studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Most successful computational approaches for protein function prediction integrate multiple genomics and proteomics data sources to make inferences about the function of unknown proteins. The most accurate of these algorithms have long running times, making them unsuitable for real-time protein function prediction in large genomes. As a result, the predictions of these algorithms are stored in static databases that can easily become outdated. We propose a new algorithm, GeneMANIA, that is as accurate as the leading methods, while capable of predicting protein function in real-time.

RESULTS:We use a fast heuristic algorithm, derived from ridge regression, to integrate multiple functional association networks and predict gene function from a single process-specific network using label propagation. Our algorithm is efficient enough to be deployed on a modern webserver and is as accurate as, or more so than, the leading methods on the MouseFunc I benchmark and a new yeast function prediction benchmark; it is robust to redundant and irrelevant data and requires, on average, less than ten seconds of computation time on tasks from these benchmarks.

CONCLUSION:GeneMANIA is fast enough to predict gene function on-the-fly while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. A prototype version of a GeneMANIA-based webserver is available at http://morrislab.med.utoronto.ca/prototype.},

abstract = {An emerging research area in computational biology and biotechnology is devoted to mathematical modeling and prediction of gene-expression patterns; it nowadays requests mathematics to deeply understand its foundations. This article surveys data mining and machine learning methods for an analysis of complex systems in computational biology. It mathematically deepens recent advances in modeling and prediction by rigorously introducing the environment and aspects of errors and uncertainty into the genetic context within the framework of matrix and interval arithmetics. Given the data from DNA microarray experiments and environmental measurements, we extract nonlinear ordinary differential equations which contain parameters that are to be determined. This is done by a generalized Chebychev approximation and generalized semi-infinite optimization. Then, time-discretized dynamical systems are studied. By a combinatorial algorithm which constructs and follows polyhedra sequences, the region of parametric stability is detected. In addition, we analyze the topological landscape of gene-environment networks in terms of structural stability. As a second strategy, we will review recent model selection and kernel learning methods for binary classification which can be used to classify microarray data for cancerous cells or for discrimination of other kind of diseases. This review is practically motivated and theoretically elaborated; it is devoted to a contribution to better health care, progress in medicine, a better education, and more healthy living conditions.},

Several alleles of each of these three loci are associated with susceptibility or protection from disease.

For example, the risk of the DRB1*03-DQB1*02/DRB1*0401-DQB1*0302 genotype is often found to be higher than for the individual DRB1*03-DQB1*02 and DRB1*0401-DQB1*0302 homozygous genotypes. It has been hypothesized that this synergy or epistasis occurs through formation of highly susceptible trans-encoded HLA-DQ(alpha 1, beta 1) heterodimers. Here, we evaluated this hypothesis by estimating the disease associations of the range of DR-DQ genotypes and their inferred dimers in a large collection of nuclear families. We determined whether the risk of haplotypes in DRB1*0401-DQB1*0302-positive genotypes relative to the DRB1*03-DQB1*02-positive genotypes is different from that of DRB1*01-DQB1*0501, which we used as a baseline reference. Several haplotypes showed a different risk compared to DRB1*01-DQB1*0501, which correlated with their ability to form certain trans-encoded DQ dimers. This result provides new evidence for the potential importance of trans-encoded HLA DQ molecules in the determination of HLA-associated risk in T1D.},

By flow cytometry we could detect the REH cells and found a background of about one event per 100 million PBMC. This sensitivity was achieved by removing four sources of false positive events, including nonspecific immunofluorescence, autofluorescence, background particles from previous experiments, and bursts of events during acquisition. To overcome limits to rare event detection imposed by nonspecific staining and autofluorescence, we used positive and negative selection for the REH cells. Another fluorochrome was added to stain the background cells and particles. In order to remove particles and background from previous experiments, a cleaning technique was developed and event bursts were removed from the analysis by developing an algorithm that screens the list-mode data for events that were not Poisson distributed.},

We designed a quantitative KIR RNAtype assay and used it to determine KIR gene expression in healthy donors and patients before HSCT. The specificity of the assay was ensured by specific primers and by electrophoretic distinction of PCR products of unique length. In 87 healthy donors, the KIR repertoire was broadly distributed (32 categories of profiles). There was an overall trend toward inverse correlation of KIR expression level and donor age. Age affected mainly the activating KIR families. Leukemia patients showed lower KIR expression before transplantation than healthy donors. Stem cell mobilization caused a transient increase of KIR expression. We conclude that KIR expression differs quantitatively with age and primary disease and is transiently altered by stem cell recruitment and selection.},

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum spirochete bacterium. The objective of this study was to explore whether KIR genotypes and haplotypes were associated with syphilis in a Chinese Han population. Polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) was used to identify the KIR genotypes in 190 patients with syphilis and 192 healthy controls. The frequency of genotype P was higher in healthy controls than that in patients with syphilis (P = 0.002), and its OR was 0.304, while the frequencies of genotypes AE and AG were higher in patients with syphilis than those in healthy controls. The frequency of haplotype 17 was lower, and its OR was 0.321, whereas the frequencies of haplotype 1 and 6 were higher in patients with syphilis than those in healthy controls. KIR haplotypes A and B have distinctive centromeric (Cen) and telomeric (Tel) gene content motifs. The frequency of Tel-B/B was higher in patients with syphilis than that in healthy controls (P = 0.024). Based on these findings, it seems that individuals with the genotype AE, AG or Tel-B/B, or haplotypes 1 and 6 are susceptible to syphilis, whereas individuals with genotype P or haplotype 17 are protective from syphilis in the Chinese Han population.},

IPD currently consists of four databases: IPD-KIR, contains the allelic sequences of Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors, IPD-MHC, is a database of sequences of the Major Histocompatibility Complex of different species; IPD-human platelet antigens, alloantigens expressed only on platelets and IPD-ESTDAB, which provides access to the European Searchable Tumour cell-line database, a cell bank of immunologically characterised melanoma cell lines. The data is currently available online from the website and ftp directory.},

abstract = {KIR genes have evolved in primates to generate a diverse family of receptors with unique structures that enable them to recognize MHC-class I molecules with locus and allele-specificity. Their combinatorial expression creates a repertoire of NK cells that surveys the expression of almost every MHC molecule independently, thus antagonizing the spread of pathogens and tumors that subvert innate and adaptive defense by selectively downregulating certain MHC class I molecules. The genes encoding KIR that recognize classical MHC molecules have diversified rapidly in human and primates; this contrasts with conservation of immunoglobulin- and lectin-like receptors for nonclassical MHC molecules. As a result of the variable KIR-gene content in the genome and the polymorphism of the HLA system, dissimilar numbers and qualities of KIR:HLA pairs function in different humans. This diversity likely contributes variability to the function of NK cells and T-lymphocytes by modulating innate and adaptive immune responses to specific challenges.},

In this article, we investigate the power of QTL linkage and association analyses for simple random sibship samples, under the variance-components model proposed by Fulker et al. After a brief description of an extension of this variance-components model, we show that the powers of both linkage and association analyses are crucially dependent on the proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to the QTL. The main difference between the two tests is that, whereas the power of association is directly related to the QTL heritability, the power of linkage is related more closely to the square of the QTL heritability. We also describe both how the power of linkage is attenuated by incomplete linkage and incomplete marker information and how the power of association is attenuated by incomplete linkage disequilibrium.},

Using retrovirally transduced NKL cells and peripheral blood NK cells from KIR3DS1-positive donors we assessed expression of this gene by flow cytometry and its function by in vitro assays measuring KIR3DS1-induced cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production. In the present study, we demonstrate that KIR3DS1 is expressed on peripheral blood NK cells and triggers both cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production. Using cotransfection and coimmunoprecipitation, we found that KIR3DS1 associates with the ITAM-bearing adaptor, DAP12. Soluble KIR3DS1-Ig fusion proteins did not bind to EBV-transformed B lymphoid cell lines transfected with HLA-Bw4 80I or 80T allotypes, suggesting that if KIR3DS1 does recognize HLA-Bw4 ligands, this may be peptide dependent.},

abstract = {A popular approach for testing and estimating genotype and haplotype effects associated with a disease outcome is to conduct a population-based case/control study, in which haplotypes are not directly observed but may be inferred probabilistically from unphased genotype data. A variety of methods exist to analyse the resulting data while accounting for the uncertainty in haplotype assignment, but most focus on the issue of testing the global null hypothesis that no genotype or haplotype effects exist. A more interesting question, once a region of disease association has been identified, is to estimate the relevant genotypic or haplotypic effects and to perform tests of complex null hypotheses such as the hypothesis that some loci, but not others, are associated with disease. Here I examine the assumptions behind, and the performance of, two classes of methods for addressing this question. The first is a weighted regression approach in which posterior probabilities of haplotype assignments are used as weights in a logistic regression analysis, generating a test based on either a weighted pseudo-likelihood, or a weighted log-likelihood. The second is a multiple imputation approach using either an improper procedure in which the posterior probabilities are used to generate replicate imputed data sets, or a proper data augmentation procedure. I compare these approaches to a simple expectation substitution (haplotype trend regression) approach. In simulations, all methods gave unbiased parameter estimation but the weighted pseudo-likelihood, expectation substitution and multiple imputation methods had superior confidence interval coverage. For the weighted pseudo-likelihood and expectation substitution methods it was necessary to estimate posterior haplotype assignment probabilities using the combined case/control data, whereas for the multiple imputation approaches it was necessary to estimate these probabilities in the case and control groups separately. Overall, multiple imputation was easiest approach to implement in standard statistical software and to extend to more complex models such as those that include gene-gene or gene-environment interactions.},

abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS:Natural killer (NK) cells serve as primary immune surveillance and are partially regulated by combinations of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes and their HLA class I ligands. Alterations in NK cell activity have been associated with type 1 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether KIR-HLA class I gene frequency: (1) is altered in a current population with type 1 diabetes compared with healthy controls; and (2) has changed over the half century in which the incidence of type 1 diabetes has increased rapidly.

METHODS:KIR-HLA class I gene frequencies were compared in 551 individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes ≤ 15 years of age (394 in a current cohort and 157 from the historical 'Golden Years' cohort) and 168 healthy controls. The overall balance of activation and inhibition was analysed using KIR-HLA genotype models.

RESULTS:Children with type 1 diabetes who were positive for KIR2DS2/KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 were more often homozygous for HLA-C group 1 and this effect was strongest in children diagnosed with diabetes before the age of 5 years (p = 0.003, corrected p [p (corr)] = 0.012) and (p = 0.001, p (corr) = 0.004), respectively. Children with type 1 diabetes have fewer inhibitory KIRs with their corresponding ligands compared with healthy controls (p = 1.9 × 10(-4)). This pattern of NK activation has not changed significantly in individuals with type 1 diabetes over the last half century.

CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:Activating combinations of KIR-HLA genes are more frequent in young children with type 1 diabetes diagnosed in the first 5 years of life, suggesting that NK cell responses may be altered in this group.},

abstract = {Cluster analysis is the automated search for groups of related observations in a dataset. Most clustering done in practice is based largely on heuristic but intuitively reasonable procedures, and most clustering methods available in commercial software are also of this type. However, there is little systematic guidance associated with these methods for solving important practical questions that arise in cluster analysis, such as how many clusters are there, which clustering method should be used, and how should outliers be handled. We review a general methodology for model-based clustering that provides a principled statistical approach to these issues. We also show that this can be useful for other problems in multivariate analysis, such as discriminant analysis and multivariate density estimation. We give examples from medical diagnosis, minefield detection, cluster recovery from noisy data, and spatial density estimation. Finally, we mention limitations of the methodology and discuss recent development...},

abstract = {The classification maximum likelihood approach is sufficiently general to encompass many current clustering algorithms, including those based on the sum of squares criterion and on the criterion of Friedman and Rubin (1967, Journal of the American Statistical Association 62, 1159-1178). However, as currently implemented, it does not allow the specification of which features (orientation, size, and shape) are to be common to all clusters and which may differ between clusters. Also, it is restricted to Gaussian distributions and it does not allow for noise. We propose ways of overcoming these limitations. A reparameterization of the covariance matrix allows us to specify that some, but not all, features be the same for all clusters. A practical framework for non-Gaussian clustering is outlined, and a means of incorporating noise in the form of a Poisson process is described. An approximate Bayesian method for choosing the number of clusters is given. The performance of the proposed methods is studied by simulation, with encouraging results. The methods are applied to the analysis of a data set arising in the study of diabetes, and the results seem better than those of previous analyses. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain is also analyzed, and the methods appear successful in extracting the main features of anatomical interest. The methods described here have been implemented in both Fortran and S-PLUS versions, and the software is freely available through StatLib.},

abstract = {Bayesian classification is currently of considerable interest. It provides a strategy for eliminating the uncertainty associated with a particular choice of classifiermodel parameters, and is the optimal decision-theoretic choice under certain circumstances when there is no single "true" classifier for a given data set. Modern computing capabilities can easily support the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling that is necessary to carry out the calculations involved, but the information available in these samples is not at present being fully utilised. We show how it can be allied to known results concerning the "reject option" in order to produce an assessment of the confidence that can be ascribed to particular classifications, and how these confidence measures can be used to compare the performances of classifiers. Incorporating these confidence measures can alter the apparent ranking of classifiers as given by straightforward success or error rates. Several possible methods for obtaining confidence assessments are described, and compared on a range of data sets using the Bayesian probabilistic nearest-neighbour classifier.},

These advances facilitate simultaneous evaluation of more parameters in single cells analyzed at higher speed. Consequently, larger and more complex data files that contain information about tens of parameters for millions of cells are generated. This increasing complexity has challenged pre-existing data analysis tools and promoted the development of new algorithms and tools for data analysis and visualization. Here, we review the currently available (conventional and newly developed) data analysis and visualization strategies that aim for easier, more objective, and robust interpretation of FC data both in biomedical research and clinical diagnostic laboratories.},

abstract = {T1DM is very common in Sweden and is positively associated with HLA class II genes. Approximately 89% of the newly diagnosed patients carry the high-risk HLA DR4-DQ8 and DR3-DQ2. The remaining 11% develop T1DM without them. This can be due to involvement of other genes and environmental factors. Natural killer (NK) cells of the innate immune system are important in antiviral and antitumor immunity. They are implicated in the etiology of autoimmune T1DM. Human NK cells express killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) that belong to the polymorphic multigene family in chromosome 19q3.4. They modulate NK cell response by interacting with HLA class I. In addition, polymorphic MICA in HLA class I interacts with non-polymorphic NKG2D receptor on NK cells. We have studied, in addition to HLA-DR and -DQ, genes of the innate immune system MICA and KIR in Latvian patients (n = 98) with T1DM and controls (n = 100). They were genotyped using standard PCR-based typing methods. MICA allele 5 is positively associated with T1DM. KIR2DL2 and KIR2DS2 were both positively associated. Combined association of MICA4 and KIR2DL2 gave an odds ration (OR) of 26.7. However, the combined risk of KIR2DL2 and HLA class II genes, HLADR3 (OR = 73.4), DR4 (OR = 66.8), and DR3 and DR4 (OR = 88.3), was higher. The maximum risk was when KIR2DL2, MICA5, and DR3/DR4 were in combination. In conclusion, our results suggest that a balance between innate and acquired immunity is important, and an imbalance coud lead to T1DM.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease in which pancreatic beta cells are selectively destroyed. Although autoimmune diseases are driven by inappropriate adaptive immunity, innate immunity may play a role in the development of T1D. To study the potential involvement of innate immunity in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, we investigated associations of the genes for 14 different killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs), the well-characterized receptors in natural killer cells, with Korean T1D patients. Genetic association analyses revealed that some of the KIR genes were associated with T1D. KIR2DL5 and 2DS2 genes were present at significantly low frequency in Korean T1D patients (P < 10(-4)). We did not detect any influence of ligand distribution on KIR association. With the haplotype assignments, 53% of the KIR haplotypes in the control are of type A. Compared with the control (P < 10(-3)) and autoantibody-negative patients (P < 10(-2)), the group A haplotype predominates in Korean patients with T1D. The KIR gene is associated with T1D and distribution differences between T1D and controls were not influenced by the HLA genes (DR-DQ-A-C). T1D, at least in Koreans, is associated with KIR genes, especially in the group A KIR haplotypes. There is a close relationship between innate and adaptive immunity.},

abstract = {Cellular signal transduction is coordinated by modifications of many proteins within cells. Protein modifications are not independent, because some are connected through shared signaling cascades and others jointly converge upon common cellular functions. This coupling creates a hidden structure within a signaling network that can point to higher level organizing principles of interest to systems biology. One can identify important covariations within large-scale datasets by using mathematical models that extract latent dimensions---the key structural elements of a measurement set. In this paper, we introduce two principal component-based methods for identifying and interpreting latent dimensions. Principal component analysis provides a starting point for unbiased inspection of the major sources of variation within a dataset. Partial least-squares regression reorients these dimensions toward a specific hypothesis of interest. Both approaches have been used widely in studies of cell signaling, and they should be standard analytical tools once highly multivariate datasets become straightforward to accumulate.},

abstract = {We investigated killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotypes in 92 patients with young-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (YT1DM: < or =35 years old), 112 patients with adult-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (AT1DM: >35 years old) and 240 control subjects. There were no differences in the frequency of KIR genotypes between controls and all the patients with T1DM or patients grouped according to age at onset of the disorder. However, when the subjects were classified into three groups according to combinations of the presence or absence of KIR3DS1/KIR3DL1 and its ligand human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-Bw4, or KIR2DL1 and its ligand HLA-C group 2, the genotype distribution was significantly different between the patients with AT1DM and controls [chi(2)= 5.993, 2 degrees of freedom (d.f.), P= 0.0500]. These data suggest that KIR polymorphisms may be associated with the age at onset of T1DM.},

abstract = {Biologists have long used model organisms to study human diseases, particularly when the model bears a close resemblance to the disease. We present a method that quantitatively and systematically identifies nonobvious equivalences between mutant phenotypes in different species, based on overlapping sets of orthologous genes from human, mouse, yeast, worm, and plant (212,542 gene-phenotype associations). These orthologous phenotypes, or phenologs, predict unique genes associated with diseases. Our method suggests a yeast model for angiogenesis defects, a worm model for breast cancer, mouse models of autism, and a plant model for the neural crest defects associated with Waardenburg syndrome, among others. Using these models, we show that SOX13 regulates angiogenesis, and that SEC23IP is a likely Waardenburg gene. Phenologs reveal functionally coherent, evolutionarily conserved gene networks-many predating the plant-animal divergence-capable of identifying candidate disease genes.},

abstract = {Oral administration of antigen leads to systemic immune unresponsiveness. Low dose oral tolerance generates regulatory cells which, when triggered in an antigen-specific manner, suppress inflammatory responses. We have previously shown that oral administration of an organ-specific antigen, porcine insulin, protects against diabetes development in the NOD mouse. In the present study we extend these observations to the B-chain of insulin, a 30-amino-acid peptide which has now been shown by others to contain the immunogenic epitope. Oral administration of the B-chain slowed diabetes development in a co-transfer model in which cells from B-chain-fed animals were co-transferred with diabetogenic cells (P=0.02). Further exposure to antigen via feeding of the co-transfer recipient animals not only slowed diabetes development but prevented diabetes in some animals (P=0.01). In vitro proliferation of popliteal lymph node cells from fed and immunized animals was suppressed in an antigen-specific manner when cells were restimulated with the fed antigen. When those cells were cultured and restimulated in vitro with the B-chain of insulin, we also observed a decrease in IFN-$\gamma$ expression and an increase in IL-4, TGF-$\beta$ and IL-10 expression. These results demonstrate that an orally protective epitope resides in the B-chain of insulin and that refeeding following adoptive transfer enhances protection. Finally, the orally administered antigen is associated with a decrease in Th1 responses and an increase in Th2 responses to the insulin B-chain.},

abstract = {Before being able to react against infectious nonself-antigens, the immune system has to be educated in the recognition and tolerance of neuroendocrine proteins and this critical process takes place only in the thymus. The development of the autoimmune diabetogenic response results from a thymus dysfunction in programing central self-tolerance to pancreatic insulin-secreting islet $\beta$ cells, leading to the breakdown of immune homeostasis with an enrichment of islet $\beta$-cell reactive effector T cells and a deficiency of $\beta$-cell specific natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) in the peripheral T-lymphocyte repertoire. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) is the dominant member of the insulin family expressed during fetal life by the thymic epithelium under the control of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene/protein. The very low degree of insulin gene transcription in normal murine and human thymus explains why the insulin protein is poorly tolerogenic as demonstrated in many studies, including the failure of all clinical trials that have attempted immune tolerance to islet $\beta$ cells via various methods of insulin administration. On the basis of the close homology and crosstolerance between insulin, the primary T1D autoantigen, and IGF-2, the dominant self-antigen of the insulin family, a novel type of vaccination, so-called `negative/tolerogenic self-vaccination', is currently being developed for the prevention and cure of T1D. If this approach were found to be effective for reprograming immunological tolerance in T1D, it could pave the way for the design of other self-vaccines against autoimmune endocrine diseases, as well as other organ-specific autoimmune diseases.},

abstract = {Autoimmune diseases need to be considered at a genetic and mechanistic level. T1D is an autoimmune, chronic, multifactorial and polygenic disease characterized by the destruction of the pancreatic $\beta$-cells associated with long term dysfunction of several organs and tissues. Mechanisms of susceptibility include epi-genetic and post-transcriptional effects that regulate transmission and expression of the inherited genes. The HLA complex, constitutes the most relevant region contributing 50% of the inherited risk for T1D. An additional 17 genes with variable but small effects have been described. In non-Caucasians, the presence of E-DR$\beta$1-74 and/or D-DR$\beta$1-57 are relevant in predisposition. The ``Diabetogenic haplotypes'' in Mexicans were DRB1*0301-DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 (OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;21.4); DRB1*0405-DQA1-*0301-DQB1*0302 (OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;44.5) and the same DQA1/DQB1 with DRB1*0404/*0401 conferring lower risk, increasing (OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;61.3) with an early age at onset and a heterozygote DR3/DR4 genotype. In most populations, the absence of D-57 and the presence of R-52 are important to the susceptibility, but in Hispanics, all DR4s (including the protective DRB1*0403/*0407/*0411) are in linkage disequilibrium with DQA1/DQB1 susceptibility alleles. Thus, susceptibility alleles in Latin American Mestizos are of Mediterranean ancestry whereas protective alleles are of Amerindian origin. In this review, we discuss the complexity of T1D and some aspects of prevention/intervention based on immunogenetics.},

Defects in thymic negative selection are thought to result in failure to delete potential $\beta$ cell-reactive T cells, contributing to the development of autoimmune diabetes. We investigated this possibility by comparing the deletion profile of double-positive (DP) thymocytes in NOD mice with diabetes-resistant strains of mice after anti-CD3 Ab treatment to trigger the TCR-mediated signaling pathway. We found that immature NOD CD4+CD8+ DP thymocytes have a lower activation threshold than C57BL/6 and Balb/c thymocytes. This was confirmed by showing that NOD DP thymocytes have a higher level of ERK and JNK phosphorylation. The low activation threshold of immature thymocytes resulted in rapid deletion of strongly activated immature DP thymocytes by negative selection, whereas weakly activated immature thymocytes differentiated more efficiently into CD69+CD3high DP thymocytes by positive selection. SP thymocytes, particularly CD4−CD8+ T cells that were efficiently generated from activated DP thymocytes, could induce severe insulitis and diabetes in NOD.scid mice. We conclude that the development of autoreactive diabetogenic T cells results from inordinate positive selection due to the low activation threshold of DP thymocytes in NOD mice.},

We show that DC subsets in each diabetic group exhibit normal properties concerning frequency and activation state, as determined using 4-color flow cytometry of whole blood cells. DC maturation is also intact as confirmed by their efficacious ability to stimulate T cell proliferation in an allogeneic MLR assay. Yet we found that DC are poor producers of IFN-$\alpha$ (P {\&}lt; 0.05) in human diabetes. IFN-$\alpha$ is a potent antiviral agent and therefore its reduced levels may interfere with T cell-mediated immune responses leading to increased susceptibility and persistence of infections in persons with diabetes.},

abstract = {It is well known that individuals positive for particular HLA-class II alleles show high risks for the development of Takayasu arteritis and other diseases caused by immunological disorders such as autoimmune diseases and allergies. HLA class II molecules present antigenic peptides to CD4+T cells. Their extensive polymorphism affects the structures of peptides bound to HLA class II molecules to create individual differences in immune responses to antigenic peptides. To better understand the mechanisms for association between HLA class II alleles and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, it is important to identify self-peptides presented by disease-susceptible HLA class II molecules and triggering disease-causative T cells. Many autoimmune diseases are observed in all ethnic groups, whereas the incidences of diseases, clinical manifestations and disease-susceptible HLA class II alleles are different among various ethnic groups for some autoimmune diseases. These phenomena suggest that differences in autoimmune self-peptide(s) in the context of disease-susceptible HLA class II molecules may cause these differences. Therefore, comparisons among disease-susceptible HLA class II alleles, autoimmune self-peptides and clinical manifestations of autoimmune diseases in different ethnic groups would be helpful in determining the pathogenesis of the diseases. In this paper, we describe our recent findings on: (1) the uniqueness of both clinical manifestations and HLA-linked genetic background of Asian-type (optico-spinal form) multiple sclerosis; (2) the structural characteristics of peptides bound to HLA-DQ molecules susceptible to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; (3) the identification of a disease-related autoantigenic peptide presented by disease-susceptible HLA-DQ molecules in Asians-specific infant onset myasthenia gravis; and (4) a manipulation of human T cell response by altered peptide ligands, as a possible candidate for new and antigen-specific immuno-suppressive therapy against autoimmune diseases.},

abstract = {Type I diabetes is the result of an autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. T cells appear to play a key role in this process. Thus far little information is available on the beta cell antigen or antigens recognized by auto-reactive T cells. Previously, we identified a 38 kD T cell antigen that appears to be localized in the membrane of insulin secretory granules and that is recognized by T cells from newly diagnosed type I diabetes patients. Other groups have reported T cell reactivity against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). To obtain an indication of whether or not $\beta$-cell reactive T cells from type I diabetes patients recognize a limited number of $\beta$-cell antigens, we cloned T-cell lines reactive with rat insulinoma (RIN) membranes from two patients and analysed their antigen specificity. We also studied the antigen specificity of one RIN membrane reactive T-cell clone (1C5), previously isolated from a third patient. From the first patient two identical RIN membrane reactive T-cell clones (7A13) were isolated. The second patient yielded two identical (23A19) RIN membrane reactive T-cell clones, and one that was different (234A33). All clones were CD4+ and saw antigen in the context of different HLA class II alleles. The reactivity of the clones was, however, not restricted to $\beta$ cells: all clones showed cross-reactivity with one or more rat tissues, with some preference for those of neuroendocrine origin, but the cross-reactivity patterns were all different. All four clones recognized different fractions electro-eluted from RIN membranes: 29--36 kDa (7A13), 120--170 (23A19), 29--41 (23A33) and 56--72 kDa (1C5). The 23A33 clone reacted with the same 38 kDa fraction electro-eluted from insulinoma membranes as a beta-cell reactive clone (1C6) published previously, but none of the other known beta cell antigen preparations tested were recognized by the T-cell clones. Finally, the subcellular localization of the antigens recognized showed at least two different patterns. These data indicate that $\beta$-cell reactive T cells from the peripheral blood of type I diabetes patients are not necessarily $\beta$-cell specific and may be heterogeneous in regard to their antigen specificity and HLA class II restriction.},

Ninety-six patients from Sweden and 96 from Lithuania matched for age and gender (1--15 years old, median age 9.0 years) were included. We analyzed autoantibodies to insulin (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and the protein tyrosine phosphatase like IA-2 (IA-2A) as well as risk-associated polymorphisms of HLA, insulin and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) genes. The frequency of patients positive for IAA and GADA was higher in Sweden than in Lithuania (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.043 and 0.032). The differences remained even when the patients were matched for HLA, insulin and CTLA-4 risk genotypes. Patients with low levels of IAA had higher levels of HbA1c and ketones at diagnosis. The frequency of the risk haplotype DR4-DQ8 was higher in Swedish than in Lithuanian patients (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.004), as well as the high-risk combination of DR4-DQ8 and DR3-DQ2 haplotypes (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.009). Our results suggest that autoimmune process against insulin and GAD65 is more common at diagnosis in children in areas with high incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D), independent of genetic risk markers. Furthermore, the disease in patients with insulin autoantibodies seems to be clinically milder.},

Here, we show that expression of IL-2R$\beta$ chains that lack tyrosine residues important for the association of the adaptor Shc and the transcription factor STAT5 in IL-2R$\beta$-deficient mice resulted in production of a normal proportion of natural Treg cells that suppressed severe autoimmunity related with deficiency in IL-2 or IL-2R. These mutant IL-2R$\beta$ chains supported suboptimal and transient STAT5 activation that upregulate the transcription factor Foxp3 to normal amounts in natural, but not induced, Treg cells. Nevertheless, gene expression profiling revealed many targets in peripheral natural Treg cells that were IL-2 dependent and a substantial overlap between the Treg cell IL-2-dependent gene program and the Treg cell transcriptional signature. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that a critical, and perhaps minor, subset of IL-2-dependent targets is indexed to a low IL-2R signaling threshold and that a substantial proportion of the Treg cell gene program is regulated by IL-2.},

The presence of strong susceptibility and resistance gene loci distinguishes this condition from other autoimmune disorders, but environmental disease factors must conspire to produce disease. The mapping of most of the genetic risk (or disease resistance) to specific alleles in the major histocompatibility locus (MHC class II) has direct functional implications for our understanding of autoimmunity in diabetes and directly implies that presentation of a likely narrow set of peptides is critical to the development of diabetic autoimmunity. While many core scientific questions remain to be answered, current insight into the disease process is beginning to have direct clinical impact with concerted efforts towards disease prevention or intervention by immunological means. In this process, identification of the critical antigenic epitopes recognized by diabetes-associated T cells has achieved highest priority.},

The transcription factor Foxp3 had been thought to determine the Treg cell lineage, a hypothesis challenged by recent observations. We have performed a cross-sectional analysis of the Treg cell signature in Treg-like cells generated under a number of conditions, with or without Foxp3, to delineate the elements that can be ascribed to T cell activation, interleukin-2, transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) signaling, or Foxp3 itself. These influences synergized to determine many of the signature's components. Much of the Treg cell signature was not ascribable to Foxp3 because it contained gene clusters that are coregulated with, but not transactivated by, Foxp3. Thus, a higher level of regulation upstream of Foxp3 determines the lineage, distinct from elements downstream of Foxp3 that are essential for its regulatory properties.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder that results in destruction of insulin-releasing $\beta$-cells of the pancreas. During the pathogenesis of T1D, at least two phases of $\beta$-cell death occur: an initiation event wherein macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokines induce $\beta$-cell necrosis and release of $\beta$-cell-specific antigens, and a second, antigen-driven event in which T-cell-mediated immune response is directed against $\beta$-cells. In contrast to macrophages and autoreactive T cells, regulatory T cells play a key role in inducing and maintaining immunological tolerance to self antigens. Therefore, modulation of the immune system may prevent the development of T1D. Herein, we proposed a cocktail regimen consisting of soluble galectin-1, rapamycin and histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) for the treatment of T1D because (a) HDACi has been reported to protect against IL-1$\beta$-mediated loss in $\beta$-cell viability, (b) HDACi and rapamycin have the ability to promote the generation and function of regulatory T cells and thus suppress the cytotoxic T-cell function, and (c) administration of soluble galectin-1 can trigger apoptosis of the $\beta$-cell-reactive T cells. This cocktail regimen may not only block T-cell- and cytokine-mediated autoimmunity but also restore self-tolerance to $\beta$-cell antigens, therefore representing a novel alternative for treatment of T1D.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes in man and the NOD (H-2g7) mouse is frequently associated with an autoimmune response to two isoforms of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), GAD65 and GAD67. GAD-specific autoantibodies produced by B cells and GAD-specific T cells have been observed in both species. In the current study, the response to a GAD65-derived peptide, GAD65 524-543, previously reported to be an epitope recognized by spleen cells obtained from 3-week-old NOD mice, was assessed in NOD MHC and non-MHC congenic strains. Although spontaneous reactivity to GAD65 524-543 was not observed in NOD mice, the peptide was immunogenic in NOD mice as well as in two NOD congenic strains which are both H-2g7, B10.H-2g7 and NOD.B6112-Tahb. This was surprising since the B10.H-2g7 strain does not develop diabetes or insulitis and fewer than 3% of NOD.B6112-Tahb mice develop diabetes. The response to GAD65 524-543 was shown to be controlled by the MHC since neither the B10 nor the NOD.H-2b strain, both of which are H-2b , responded to the peptide. This study demonstrates that T cell responsiveness to GAD-derived peptides can be elicited in strains of mice that are resistant to the development of spontaneous diabetes, suggesting that peripheral tolerance to GAD is not associated with protection from diabetes.},

abstract = {Antigen-specific CD8 suppressor T cells (CD8+ Ts) are adaptive regulatory T cells that are induced in vivo and in vitro by chronic antigenic stimulation of human T cells. CD8+ Ts induce the upregulation of the inhibitory receptors ILT3 and ILT4 on monocytes and dendritic cells rendering these antigen presenting cells (APCs) tolerogenic. Tolerogenic APCs induce CD4+ T helper anergy and elicit the differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+ T regulatory/suppressor cells. Overexpression of membrane ILT3 in APC results in inhibition of NF-$\kappa$B activation, transcription of inflammatory cytokines and costimulatory molecules. Soluble ILT3-Fc which contains only the extracellular, Ig-like domain linked to mutated IgG1 Fc, is strongly immunosuppressive. ILT3-Fc, induces the differentiation of human CD8+ Ts which inhibit CD4+ Th and CD8+ CTL effector function both in vitro and in vivo. The acquisition of Ts' function by primed CD8+ T cells treated with ILT3-Fc was demonstrated to be the effect of the significant upregulation of BCL6, a transcriptional repressor of IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-5 and granzyme B. The upregulated expression of BCL6, SOCS1 and DUSP10 is integral to the signature of ILT3-Fc-induced CD8+ Ts. These genes are known inhibitors of cytokine production and TCR signaling and are targeted by miRNAs which are suppressed by ILT3-Fc. ILT3-Fc induces tolerance to allogeneic human islets and reverses rejection after its onset in a humanized NOD/SCID mouse model. Based on these findings we postulate that ILT3-Fc may become an important new agent for treatment of autoimmunity and transplant rejection.},

Therefore, we aimed to determine if IGRP is an antigen in T1D patients and to identify the HLA-A2-restricted IGRP epitopes targeted. Using IFN-$\gamma$ ELISPOT assay, we tested PBMC from recent-onset pediatric T1D patients and healthy controls for reactivity to four IGRP peptides directly ex vivo. Importantly, 65% of patients and 0% of controls were positive for at least one IGRP peptide. Two of these have not been reported previously. These data provide evidence that IGRP is a CD8+ T cell antigen in humans, contributing to the understanding of the underlying disease process as well as to future directions for diagnosis and monitoring disease progression in T1D patients.},

Herein, we demonstrate that in mice, CB4 infection of insulin-producing pancreatic $\beta$ cells does not directly cause $\beta$ cell death. Instead, we observed the phagocytosis of $\beta$ cells by macrophages following infection. Further, antigen-presenting cells isolated from CB4-infected mice induced diabetes upon adoptive transfer. Therefore, the specificity of CB4 for infection of $\beta$ cells leads indirectly to the development of IDDM. This generalized mechanism suggests that macrophages are the initiating pathogenic cell type during virus-mediated autoimmune diabetes and that multiple environmental agents specific for $\beta$ cells could cause IDDM.},

Methods One hundred and thirty-four cases with T1D and 324 non-diabetic control subjects were selected randomly from Han Chinese. Three tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs712701, rs2233580, rs2233575) according to HapMap data were selected to analyze. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to genotype. Results No difference was found in genotype or allele frequencies between patients and non-diabetic controls in all three SNPs. No difference was found in common haplotypes constructed by these three SNPs, either. For the SNP rs2233575, in non-diabetic controls, the carriers with AA and GA genotypes had lower plasma insulin level than the subjects with GG genotype (P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.048). Conclusions The present study identified that the PAX4 gene was not associated with the risk of T1D in a Han Chinese sample, suggesting that it is unlikely to have a major effect on the susceptibility to T1D in this population. This is the first study on the PAX4 gene in a Chinese population.},

abstract = {It has long been established that type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease, with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells being largely responsible for the destruction of $\beta$ cells within the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Although autoantibodies specific for islet cell proteins are regularly detected in individuals with T1D and can be utilized as effective markers for predicting the onset of disease, they are not believed to be directly pathogenic to $\beta$ cells. Thus, activation of autoantibody-secreting B cells has long been regarded as a secondary consequence of the ongoing self-reactive T cell response. However, recently, studies in the nonobese diabetic mouse model of disease have demonstrated that B cells are an important component in the development of T1D by virtue of their ability to act as the preferential antigen presenting cell population required for efficient expansion of diabetogenic CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, autoantibodies might also be responsible for mediating early $\beta$ cell pathogenesis in this model.},

abstract = {Objective To assess initial efficacy and feasibility of a telephone-based supportive intervention for parents of young children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) designed to improve parental quality of life (QOL) through decreased parental stress, increased social support, and improved daily management of their child's diabetes. Methods The research team developed a brief program based on social cognitive theory for parents of young children with T1D. Twenty-four parents (88% mothers) of young children with T1D (ages 2--5 years) participated in a pilot study of the program and completed psychosocial questionnaires and a program satisfaction survey. Results Paired t-tests of pre- and post-intervention scores suggested a favorable within-group impact for the intervention group, as evidenced by decreased pediatric parenting stress and a trend for increased perceived social support. The program was well-received, with the majority of participants rating it as helpful and interesting. Conclusion Assisting parents with the unique challenges of diabetes management in young children through implementation of a structured intervention is promising. Practice implications A telephone-based intervention focused on child development, coping, and problem-solving skills has the potential to positively impact parents' QOL and may have implications for children's health.},

abstract = {The long asymptomatic period before the onset of chronic diseases offers good opportunities for disease prevention. Indeed, many chronic diseases may be preventable by avoiding those factors that trigger the disease process (primary prevention) or by use of therapy that modulates the disease process before the onset of clinical symptoms (secondary prevention). Accurate prediction is vital for disease prevention so that therapy can be given to those individuals who are most likely to develop the disease. The utility of predictive markers is dependent on three parameters, which must be carefully assessed: sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. Specificity is important if a biomarker is to be used to identify individuals either for counseling or for preventive therapy. However, a reciprocal relationship exists between sensitivity and specificity. Thus, successful biomarkers will be highly specific without sacrificing sensitivity. Unfortunately, biomarkers with ideal specificity and sensitivity are difficult to find for many diseases. One potential solution is to use the combinatorial power of a large number of biomarkers, each of which alone may not offer satisfactory specificity and sensitivity. Recent technological advances in genetics, genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics offer a great opportunity for biomarker discovery. The newly identified biomarkers have the potential to bring increased accuracy in disease diagnosis and classification, as well as therapeutic monitoring. In this review, we will use type 1 diabetes (T1D) as an example, when appropriate, to discuss pertinent issues related to high throughput biomarker discovery.},

abstract = {Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder known to be associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1 ∗0602 in humans. In a canine model, the disorder is also genetically linked to a gene of high homology with the human $\mu$-switch-like immunoglobulin (Ig) gene (current LOD score 13.6 at 0% recombination). Since association with HLA or other immune function polymorphic genes (T cell receptor of Ig, mainly) is a hallmark of most autoimmune diseases, it is proposed that autoimmunity may also play a role in the development of narcolepsy. Arguments for and against this hypothesis are reviewed. It is shown that both on the basis of the most recent molecular studies, and because of some of its clinical features, narcolepsy may be an autoimmune disorder. However, neither systemic nor central nervous system (CNS) evidence of any autoimmune abnormality have ever been found. To reconcile this discrepancy, it is suggested that the pathological immune process involved in narcolepsy could be difficult to detect because it is restricted to a very small region of the brain or targets a low abundance neuroeffector. Alternatively, it is possible that a more fundamental relationship is involved between sleep generation and immune regulation. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy may then involve new CNS-immune mechanisms that may shed new light on the sleep process itself.},

We herein investigated the ability of a novel multimeric form of FasL chimeric with streptavidin (SA-FasL) having potent apoptotic activity to induce apoptosis in diabetogenic T cells and modulate insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes (IDDM) in an adoptive transfer model. Diabetogenic splenocytes from NOD/Lt females were co-cultured in vitro with SA-FasL, SA control protein, or alone without protein, and adoptively transferred into NOD/Lt-Rag1null recipients for diabetes development. All animals receiving control (Alone: n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;16 or SA: n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;17) cells developed diabetes on average by 6 weeks, whereas animals receiving SA-FasL-treated (n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;25) cells exhibited significantly delayed progression (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;.001) and decreased incidence (70%). This effect was associated with an increase in CD4+CD25+ T cells and correlated with FoxP3 expression in pancreatic lymph nodes. Extracorporeal treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes using SA-FasL during disease onset represents a novel approach that may alter the ability of pathogenic T cells to mediate diabetes and have therapeutic utility in clinical management of IDDM.},

abstract = {Endothelin (ET) and bone morphogenic proteins (BMP) have been implicated in the development of micro- and macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus due to atherosclerosis. This study investigated vascular BMP-expression during early development of experimental autoimmune diabetes mellitus and whether ETA receptors are involved in its regulation, using the selective ETA receptor antagonist BSF461314. Specificity of BSF461314 was confirmed through ET-mediated p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation experiments. For animal studies, non-obese diabetic (NOD) and control mice at 16 weeks of age were treated with BSF461314 for 6 weeks. Plasma glucose levels were measured before and after treatment and vascular gene expression of BMP-2, BMP-7, and BMP-type II receptor was determined in the aorta by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. At the beginning of the study in all animals, plasma glucose levels were within the normal range. After 6 weeks gene expression of vascular BMP-2, BMP-7 and BMP-type II receptor was almost doubled in NOD mice compared with non-diabetic controls (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05). Concomitant treatment with BSF461314 significantly reduced expression of all BMPs and lowered plasma glucose levels in NOD mice close to controls (all p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05 versus untreated). In conclusion, vascular BMP-2, BMP-7, and BMP-type II receptor expression is upregulated in early stages of autoimmune diabetes mellitus. The data further indicate that ETA receptors inhibit diabetes-associated activation of vascular BMPs and regulate plasma glucose levels suggesting that ETA receptors might provide a new therapeutic target to interfere with the early development of atherosclerosis in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.},

However, what attracts or restricts broadly autoreactive lymphocyte pools to the pancreas remains unclear. We report that TRPV1+ pancreatic sensory neurons control islet inflammation and insulin resistance. Eliminating these neurons in diabetes-prone NOD mice prevents insulitis and diabetes, despite systemic persistence of pathogenic T cell pools. Insulin resistance and $\beta$ cell stress of prediabetic NOD mice are prevented when TRPV1+ neurons are eliminated. TRPV1NOD, localized to the Idd4.1 diabetes-risk locus, is a hypofunctional mutant, mediating depressed neurogenic inflammation. Delivering the neuropeptide substance P by intra-arterial injection into the NOD pancreas reverses abnormal insulin resistance, insulitis, and diabetes for weeks. Concordantly, insulin sensitivity is enhanced in trpv1−/− mice, whereas insulitis/diabetes-resistant NODxB6Idd4-congenic mice, carrying wild-type TRPV1, show restored TRPV1 function and insulin sensitivity. Our data uncover a fundamental role for insulin-responsive TRPV1+ sensory neurons in $\beta$ cell function and diabetes pathoetiology.},

Here, we review recent work concerning the structure, signaling, and function of the IL-2R, emphasizing the contribution of IL-2 for T cell-dependent activity in vivo. IL-2R signaling influences two discrete aspects of immune responses by CD8+ T cells, terminal differentiation of effector cells in primary responses, and aspects of memory recall responses. IL-2 also delivers essential signals for thymic development of regulatory T (Treg) cells and later to promote their homeostasis and function. Each of these outcomes on T effector and Treg cells requires distinct amounts of IL-2R signaling, with low IL-2R signaling sufficient for many key aspects of Treg cells. Thus, tolerance is readily maintained and favored with limited IL-2.},

abstract = {Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes in humans is characterized by a T cell mediated destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic $\beta$ cells. This autoimmune response is very similar to that seen in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse strain. Originally bred from the ICR cataract-prone strain, NOD mice spontaneously develop T cell mediated insulitis and type I diabetes by the age of 6 months. Backcross studies with the NOD mouse strain indicate segregation of at least three recessive genes. One of these, Iddm-1, has been shown to be tightly linked to the mouse MHC, H-2 on chromosome 17. Comparative studies with diabetic patients has also shown linkage to human HLA with protective and predisposing haplotypes being present within the population. In this study we have attempted to identify restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) between the genomes of the NOD mouse strain and the diabetes-resistant strain C57BL/10. Such polymorphic loci will be used to screen DNAs from backcross animals that are diagnosed diabetic in an attempt to identify probes linked to the non-H2 disease susceptibility genes.},

Two likely candidate susceptibility genes in this region have been identified: the DQ$\beta$3.2 gene is the single allele most highly associated with type I diabetes (IDDM) and accounts for the HLA-DR4 association with that disease. DNA sequence analysis and mutagenesis studies implicate a small set of key residues within the DQ3.2 molecule as critical polymorphic residues likely contributing to disease-associated immune mechanisms. Different class II genes, Dw4 and Dw14, specific alleles at the DR$\beta$ locus, account for the HLA-DR4 association with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A single cluster of polymorphic residues within the DR$\beta$ molecule may be sufficient to account for nearly all of the structural and genetic contributions of the HLA complex to the pathogenesis of RA.},

abstract = {Our goals were to determine whether Type 1 diabetes (T1D) alters neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-dependent reactivity of cerebral arterioles and to identify a potential role for oxidative stress in T1D-induced impairment in nNOS-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles. Rats were injected with vehicle (sodium citrate buffer) or streptozotocin (50 mg/kg IP) to induce T1D. Two to three months later, we measured functional responses of cerebral arterioles to nNOS-dependent (NMDA and kainate) and -independent (nitroglycerin) agonists in nondiabetic and diabetic rats before and during inhibition of oxidative stress using tempol (100 $\mu$M). In addition, we measured superoxide anion production under basal conditions, during stimulation with NMDA and kainate, and during treatment with tempol. We found that nNOS-dependent, but -independent, vasodilatation was impaired in diabetic compared to nondiabetic rats. In addition, treatment of the cerebral microcirculation with tempol restored impaired nNOS-dependent vasodilatation in diabetic rats toward that observed in nondiabetic rats. Furthermore, the production of superoxide anion (lucigenin chemiluminescence) was increased in parietal cortical tissue of diabetic rats under basal conditions. Application of NMDA and kainate did not increase superoxide anion production in nondiabetic or diabetic rats. However, tempol decreased basal production of superoxide anion in diabetic rats. Our findings suggest that T1D impairs nNOS-dependent dilatation of cerebral arterioles by a mechanism that appears to be related to the formation of superoxide anion.},

We analyzed 11 markers covering a 4-Mb region telomeric to the DQB1 gene in Finnish nuclear families with parents carrying either the DR8-DQB1*04 (n=188) or the DRB1*0404-DQB1*0302 haplotypes (n=135). On the DRB1*0404-DQB1*0302 haplotype we found independent disease association of the D6S273 and C125 markers (pcorr = 10−4 and 0.0095, respectively). The C125*200 alleles on this haplotype conferred an increased disease risk (OR = 3.6; p = 0.003). The B*39 allele also showed disease association (OR = 2.6; p = 0.054). The C125*200 allele appeared at an increased frequency also on transmitted B39 positive DRB1*0404-DQB1*0302 haplotypes, suggesting an independent effect. In addition, the C143*417 allele on the DRB1*08-DQB1*04 haplotype was associated with decreased disease risk (OR = 0.48, p = 0.003). Our data confirm that non--class II HLA loci affect genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. In addition to HLA B*39 the C125 locus contributes to disease risk on the Finnish DRB1*0404-DQB1*0302 haplotypes. Another locus close to D6S273 may also have an effect. For the first time we report that a locus near the C143 marker appear to affect disease association of the DRB1*08-DQB1*04 haplotype.},

abstract = {SUMMARY:Here we present INRICH (INterval enRICHment analysis), a pathway-based genome-wide association analysis tool that tests for enriched association signals of predefined gene-sets across independent genomic intervals. INRICH has wide applicability, fast running time and, most importantly, robustness to potential genomic biases and confounding factors. Such factors, including varying gene size and single-nucleotide polymorphism density, linkage disequilibrium within and between genes and overlapping genes with similar annotations, are often not accounted for by existing gene-set enrichment methods. By using a genomic permutation procedure, we generate experiment-wide empirical significance values, corrected for the total number of sets tested, implicitly taking overlap of sets into account. By simulation we confirm a properly controlled type I error rate and reasonable power of INRICH under diverse parameter settings. As a proof of principle, we describe the application of INRICH on the NHGRI GWAS catalog.

Research design and methods During closed-loop glucose control, insulin infusion rates on a subcutaneous insulin pump are adjusted by a control algorithm according to subcutaneous glucose sensor readings. A literature review is performed and personal experience of work with closed-loop systems at the University of Cambridge, UK, is presented. Results The main challenges in the management of T1D in children are identified together with a summary of current therapeutics options. Review of the literature recognises hypoglycaemia as a limiting factor for the attainment of optimal glycaemic control, primarily in children. Additional specific confounding issues include unpredictable eating and exercise patterns especially in the youngest age group. Closed-loop systems might be particularly helpful, but have to consider increased insulin sensitivity, lower insulin doses, and human factors such as size and usability of closed-loop components. Conclusions Closed-loop systems may represent an alternative treatment option to achieve target glucose levels whilst reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia in children with T1D.},

Recently, a number of $\beta$ cell autoantigens have been identified. However, their role in mediating the diabetogenic response is not know. Here we assess the relative importance of a panel of $\beta$ cell autoantigens in the disease process. The approach was to inhibit T cell proliferation to a given autoantigen by either i.t. or i.v. injections, and then determine the effect this had on the diabetogenic response. We show that administering murine glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) to 3-week-old NOD females can reduce the frequency of insulitis and prevent the onset of diabetes. In contrast, carboxypeptidase H or peripherin do not induce a similar protective effect, suggesting that GAD has a critical role in the diabetogenic response. These results also suggest that GAD may provide a useful target for antigen-specific immunotherapy.},

Our results demonstrated a progressive decrease in the Treg cell:Teff cell ratio in inflamed islets but not in pancreatic lymph nodes. Intra-islet Treg cells expressed reduced amounts of CD25 and Bcl-2, suggesting that their decline was due to increased apoptosis. Additionally, administration of low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoted Treg cell survival and protected mice from developing diabetes. Together, these results suggest intra-islet Treg cell dysfunction secondary to defective IL-2 production is a root cause of the progressive breakdown of self-tolerance and the development of diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice.},

abstract = {Abstract The pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes begins with the activation of autoimmune T killer cells and is followed by their homing into the pancreatic islets. After penetrating the pancreatic islets, T cells directly contact and destroy insulin‐producing $\beta$ cells. This review provides an overview of the dynamic interactions which link T cell membrane type‐1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1‐MMP) and the signaling adhesion CD44 receptor with T cell transendothelial migration and the subsequent homing of the transmigrated cells to the pancreatic islets. MT1‐MMP regulates the functionality of CD44 in diabetogenic T cells. By regulating the functionality of T cell CD44, MT1‐MMP mediates the transition of T cell adhesion to endothelial cells to the transendothelial migration of T cells, thus, controlling the rate at which T cells home into the pancreatic islets. As a result, the T cell MT1‐MMP‐CD44 axis controls the severity of the disease. Inhibition of MT1‐MMP proteolysis of CD44 using highly specific and potent synthetic inhibitors, which have been clinically tested in cancer patients, reduces the rate of transendothelial migration and the homing of T cells. Result is a decrease in the net diabetogenic efficiency of T cells and a restoration of $\beta$ cell mass and insulin production in NOD mice. The latter is a reliable and widely used model of type I diabetes in humans. Overall, existing experimental evidence suggests that there is a sound mechanistic rationale for clinical trials of the inhibitors of T cell MT1‐MMP in human type 1 diabetes patients.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is increasing in incidence worldwide, particularly in young children. Studies have suggested that weight gain in early childhood may play a role in determining disease risk, with increased risk in children who have gained more weight. We hypothesized that leptin may be involved by promoting a Th1-type immune response in individuals at risk for the development of T1DM. Insulin, GAD65, and IA-2 autoantibodies and leptin levels were measured in relatives of T1DM patients and in control subjects. After adjusting for HLA risk and age, autoantibody-positive relatives were compared with sex- and BMI-matched autoantibody-negative control subjects. BMI-matched individuals had similar leptin levels, and the leptin levels increased with increasing BMI Z-score, as expected. However, we did not demonstrate higher leptin levels in autoantibody-positive relatives, compared with autoantibody-negative control subjects. Thus, elevations in leptin levels do not appear to be a major determinant of whether an individual develops autoimmunity. If elevated BMI and associated elevations in leptin levels are risk factors for the initiation and/or progression of autoimmunity, they may act more as permissive factors in this process, in the setting of a certain degree of genetic predisposition.},

However, the physiological role of PLAD in the regulation of TNFR-mediated immune responses in autoimmunity is still unclear. By using the recombinant PLAD.Fc protein to block TNFR1 assembly, we demonstrated that PLAD.Fc treatment significantly reduced the TNFR1-driving proinflammatory cytokines and protected NOD mice from diabetes. Strikingly, Th17 differentiation was significantly inhibited in PLAD.Fc-treated NOD and TNFR1-deficient mice, indicating a TNFR1-dependent Th17 development. PLAD.Fc-modulated effects on DCs, in terms of the downregulation of Th17-inducing cytokines, IL-6 and TGF-$\beta$, explained the potential mechanism for Th17 suppression. Finally, we provided an additional result that PLAD.Fc administration diminished the infiltration of Th17 cells in the central nervous system and ameliorated the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. Collectively, these data demonstrated that targeting PLAD of TNFR1 provides protection from autoimmune diseases through the downregulation of Th17 and suggested a therapeutic potential of PLAD-modulation in TNF-involved inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {Group B coxsackieviruses (CVB) are believed to trigger some cases of human type 1 diabetes (T1D), although the mechanism by which this may occur has not been shown. We demonstrated previously that inoculation of young nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice with any of several different CVB strains reduced T1D incidence. We also observed no evidence of CVB replication within islets of young NOD mice, suggesting no role for CVB in T1D induction in the NOD mouse model. The failure to observe CVB replication within islets of young NOD mice has been proposed to be due to interferon expression by insulin-producing beta cells or lack of expression of the CVB receptor CAR. We found that CAR protein is detectable within islets of young and older NOD mice and that a CVB3 strain, which expresses murine IL-4, can replicate in islets. Mice inoculated with the IL-4 expressing CVB3 chimeric strain were better protected from T1D onset than were mock-infected control mice despite intraislet viral replication. Having demonstrated that CVB can replicate in healthy islets of young NOD mice when the intraislet environment is suitably altered, we asked whether islets in old prediabetic mice were resistant to CVB infection. Unlike young mice in which insulitis is not yet apparent, older NOD mice demonstrate severe insulitis in all islets. Inoculating older prediabetic mice with different pathogenic CVB strains caused accelerated T1D onset relative to control mice, a phenomenon that was preceded by detection of virus within islets. Together, the results suggest a model for resolving conflicting data regarding the role of CVB in human T1D etiology.},

Efficacy was associated with reduced insulitis and a suppression of the pathogenic T helper cell type 1 and type 17 phenotypes in peripheral lymphoid organs.

How T cell deletion is regulated so that nTreg cells are generated is unclear. Here we showed that transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) signaling protected nTreg cells and antigen-stimulated conventional T cells from apoptosis. Enhanced apoptosis of TGF-$\beta$ receptor-deficient nTreg cells was associated with high expression of proapoptotic proteins Bim, Bax, and Bak and low expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Ablation of Bim in mice corrected the Treg cell development and homeostasis defects. Our results suggest that nTreg cell commitment is independent of TGF-$\beta$ signaling. Instead, TGF-$\beta$ promotes nTreg cell survival by antagonizing T cell negative selection. These findings reveal a critical function for TGF-$\beta$ in control of autoreactive T cell fates with important implications for understanding T cell self-tolerance mechanisms.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary The incidence of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) has tremendously increased in industrialized countries over the past decades in the finish pediatric population. The expectation is that the number of new cases diagnosed at or before 14 years of age will double in the next decade and the age of onset will be younger (0--4 years). There is an urgent need for establishing safe immunointervention procedures that may provide a real cure for the disease without necessitating prolonged exposure of patients to immunosuppressive drugs with all the attendant problems of recurrent infections and drug toxicity. At variance with conventional therapies, CD3 antibodies present the possibility to induce long-term effects following a short administration. The challenge in future is to improve the conditions of their use by ameliorating the safety profile, better defining the subsets of patients who will benefit more from the treatment and envisaging which drug combinations are most profitable. This will benefit from advances made in devising assays to detect directly pathogenic islet-specific T cells or to quantify B-cell mass using noninvasive methods that will be a major added value for the selection and the monitoring of patients.},

Research in the genetics of autoimmunity has been impelled by the isolation of genetic markers allowing tracing of heredity. The annotation and sequencing of the human and mouse genomes provide with the potential for further advancements, through the development of new technologies. This review aims to summarize advances made in the autoimmunity field, centered in type 1 diabetes in the NOD mouse model. It also aims to demonstrate that animal models, albeit some phenotypic and genetic dissimilarities with the human diseases, still remain the best way to move towards an understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in autoimmunity. Assessing the current state of research in this field together with the increasing potential of novel biotechnology advancements, new insights to disease pathogenesis and discovery of molecular targets for intervention strategies are anticipated in the coming years.},

Using pooled DNA from individuals with asthma, Crohn's disease (CD), schizophrenia, type 1 diabetes (T1D), and controls, we selected 534 SNPs from an initial set of 1435 SNPs spanning a 25-Mb region on chromosome 6p21. The standard deviations of measurements of time of flight at different dots, from different PCRs, and from different pools indicate reliable results on each analysis step. In 90% of the disease-control comparisons we found allelic differences of {\&}lt;10%. Of the T1D samples, which served as a positive control, 10 SNPs with significant differences were observed after taking into account multiple testing. Of these 10 SNPs, 5 are located between DQB1 and DRB1, confirming the known association with the DR3 and DR4 haplotypes whereas two additional SNPs also reproduced known associations of T1D with DOB and LTA. In the CD pool also, two earlier described associations were found with SNPs close to DRB1 and MICA. Additional associations were found in the schizophrenia and asthma pools. They should be confirmed in individual samples or can be used to develop further quality criteria for accepting true differences between pools. The determination of SNP allele frequencies in pooled DNA appears to be of value in assigning further genotyping priorities also in large linkage regions.},

Our aim was to investigate, in two previously used animal models, the NOD mouse and the BB/W rat, the in vivo tissue distribution of radio-labeled IL-2. If the radio-labeled IL-2 accumulated significantly in the pancreas compared to surrounding organs it could allow imaging of lymphocyte infiltration of the islets of Langerhans by scintigraphic methods. IL-2 was labeled enzymatically with125Iodine. Radio-labeled IL-2 was injected iv in prediabetic NOD mice, diabetic NOD mice and Balb/c mice in the first animal model and in BB rats in the second model. Animals were sacrificed at different time points and the activity in different organs was measured. It was found that the mean activity in the pancreas in both diabetic and prediabetic NOD mice was significantly higher compared to pancreas from Balb/c mice (P{\&}lt; 0.001 and P=0.005, respectively). However, the mean activity in the pancreas was at the lower range of the surrounding organs in both animal models, thereby excluding the possibility of imaging the autoimmune process by scintigraphic methods. It is concluded that radio-labeled IL-2 did accumulate significantly in the pancreas of NOD mice compared to control mice but there is a need to develop new techniques in order to visualize the localized activity.},

We studied the effect of the INS −23A/T, PTPN22 1858C/T, and CTLA-4 +49A/G polymorphisms on the emergence of T1D-associated autoimmunity in children exposed to cow's milk (CM) based formula during early or late infancy. The study comprised of 156 children from the Finnish DIPP cohort who had developed ≥ 2 types of autoantibodies (ICA, IAA, GADA or IA-2A) or clinical T1D and 563 control children. The PTPN22 1858T allele was associated with the appearance of the autoantibodies and clinical T1D among children exposed to CM formula before the age of 6 months (PTPN22: for all P ≤ 0.001, Log Rank test), but not among children exposed later on. Cox regression analysis showed an interaction between early CM exposure and 1858T allele and enhanced appearance of ICA, IAA and IA-2A (for all P ≤ 0.04). Our results imply that the PTPN22 polymorphism affects the development of T1D-associated autoimmunity only if children are exposed to CM formula during early infancy suggesting an interplay between genetic and environmental factors. This may provide an explanation for the contradictory findings on the significance of CM formula exposure in T1D.},

abstract = {Glucose transporter-2 (glut2) is underexpressed in $\beta$ cells of several rodent models of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). This may also be true for rodent models of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The present study examines two murine models of autoimmune IDDM, the nonobese diabetic (NOD) and the low-dose streptozotocin (stz) murine models for changes in the expression of glut2 by double-label light and confocal microscopy during various stages of the disease. The spatial distribution of glut2 cells was also examined in relation to insulin immunoreactive cells and the islet inflammatory cells during these stages. In both the female NOD mouse and the female Swiss mouse without stz treatment, glut2 colocalized with insulin in virtually all the $\beta$ cells. In the NOD mouse, islets with moderate to advanced insulitis showed either an absence or considerably reduced expression of glut2 in insulin-containing $\beta$ cells. Cells with reduced glut2 expression were usually located adjacent to the region of insulitis. At onset of diabetes, glut2 immunolabeling was reduced despite the preservation of weak insulin immunoreactivity. In Swiss mice treated repeatedly with stz, glut2 labeling began to decline in selected $\beta$ cells after the fourth injection in approximately 50% of the islets, despite the lack of insulitis. At this stage expression of glut2 fell in a small number of islets with evidence of early macrophage infiltration. Loss of glut2 became more pronounced in nondiabetic Swiss mice after the fifth injection. At this stage glut2 labeling in the plasma membrane appeared diffuse and variable. At onset of stz-induced diabetes, glut2 expression significantly fell, despite weak immunoreactivity for insulin. This loss was associated with an enhanced influx of both macrophages and T lymphocytes within the islets of diabetic mice. In both the NOD and the low-dose stz mouse models, loss of glut2 thus occurs from an early stage and precedes hyperglycaemia. This loss may be mediated by immune and nonimmune mechanisms.},

abstract = {The inference of regulatory and biochemical networks from large-scale genomics data is a basic problem in molecular biology. The goal is to generate testable hypotheses of gene-to-gene influences and subsequently to design bench experiments to confirm these network predictions. Coexpression of genes in large-scale gene-expression data implies coregulation and potential gene-gene interactions, but provide little information about the direction of influences. Here, we use both time-series data and genetics data to infer directionality of edges in regulatory networks: time-series data contain information about the chronological order of regulatory events and genetics data allow us to map DNA variations to variations at the RNA level. We generate microarray data measuring time-dependent gene-expression levels in 95 genotyped yeast segregants subjected to a drug perturbation. We develop a Bayesian model averaging regression algorithm that incorporates external information from diverse data types to infer regulatory networks from the time-series and genetics data. Our algorithm is capable of generating feedback loops. We show that our inferred network recovers existing and novel regulatory relationships. Following network construction, we generate independent microarray data on selected deletion mutants to prospectively test network predictions. We demonstrate the potential of our network to discover de novo transcription-factor binding sites. Applying our construction method to previously published data demonstrates that our method is competitive with leading network construction algorithms in the literature.},

Combined treatment with B:9-23 peptide and polyinosinic--polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), but neither alone, induce insulitis in normal BALB/c mice. In contrast, the combined treatment accelerated insulitis, but prevented diabetes in NOD mice. Our immunofluorescence study with anti-CD4/anti-Foxp3 revealed that the proportion of Foxp3 positive CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) was elevated in the islets of NOD mice treated with B:9-23 peptide and poly I:C, as compared to non-treated mice. Depletion of Tregs by anti-CD25 antibody hastened spontaneous development of diabetes in non-treated NOD mice, and abolished the protective effect of the combined treatment and conversely accelerated the onset of diabetes in the treated mice. These results indicate that poly I:C combined with B:9-23 peptide promotes infiltration of both pathogenic T cells and predominantly Tregs into the islets, thereby inhibiting progression from insulitis to overt diabetes in NOD mice.},

abstract = {Summary Diabetes mellitus is associated with a greater risk of developing atherosclerosis and its complications: stroke, myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular disease. In patients with diabetes, atherosclerosis represents a complex multifactorial disease with increased lesion progression and severity compared to the nondiabetic population. Several risk factors have been proposed to explain the increased risk of cardiovascular disease with diabetes. They include: hyperglycae-mia, dyslipidemia, accelerated formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), increased oxidative stress, and genetic factors. It is difficult to precisely establish the elements leading to diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis by means of epidemiological studies because all these factors coexist in diabetic patients. Thus, diabetic animal models that reproduce exacerbation of atherosclerosis would be helpful to understand why atherosclerosis is accelerated by diabetes, and to design appropriate treatments to limit its progression. This review analyzes most of the animal models developed to reproduce diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, and summarizes the effects of hyperglycaemia and lipid abnormalities on atherogenesis.},

abstract = {Susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D) is determined by complex interactions between several genetic loci and environmental factors. Alleles at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus explain up to 50% of the familial clustering of T1D, and the remainder is contributed to by multiple loci, of which only four were known until recently. First-stage results of genome-wide association (GWA) studies performed with high-density genotyping arrays have already produced four novel loci and the promise that, with the completion of the second stage of the GWA studies, most of the genetic basis of T1D will be known. We will review what is known to date about the mechanisms of genetic susceptibility to T1D, with special emphasis on possible diagnostic and therapeutic applications of these recent genetic findings.},

In the case of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), discrimination of the various subpopulations of blood cells is an important task. In this work, our objective is to provide a useful paradigm of computer-based assistance in the domain of flow-cytometric data analysis by proposing a Bayesian methodology for flow cytometry clustering. Using Bayesian clustering, we replicate a series of (unsupervised) data clustering tasks, usually performed manually by the expert. The proposed methodology is able to incorporate the expert's knowledge, as prior information to data-driven statistical learning methods, in a simple and efficient way. We observe almost optimal clustering results, with respect to the expert's gold standard. The model is flexible enough to identify correctly non canonical clustering structures, despite the presence of various abnormalities and heterogeneities in data; it offers an advantage over other types of approaches that apply hierarchical or distance-based concepts.},

abstract = {Alleles of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes are well known to affect susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D), but less is known about the contribution of HLA class I alleles to T1D susceptibility. In this study, molecular genotyping was performed at the HLA-B and HLA-C loci for 283 multiplex Caucasian families, previously typed for HLA-A and the class II loci. Allele frequencies were compared between affected siblings and affected family-based controls. Linkage disequilibrium coefficients were calculated for HLA-B-HLA-C haplotypes and for class I-lass II haplotypes. After adjustment for linkage disequilibrium, the following alleles remain associated with T1D: B*1801, B*3906, B*4403, C*0303, C*0802, and C*1601. B and C allele associations were tested for certain T1D-associated DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes, with the following results: B*3801 is protective on DRB1*0401-DQB1*0302 haplotypes, both C*0701 and C*0702 are predisposing on DRB1*0404-DQB1*0302 haplotypes, and B*3906 is predisposing on DRB1*0801-DQB1*0402 haplotypes. As with previous results for HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C are associated with age at T1D onset (mean 11.6 $\pm$ 0.3 years). The protective allele B*4403 was associated with older age at onset (15.1 years; p {\&}lt; 0.04), and the predisposing alleles C*0702 and B*3906 were associated with younger age at onset (9.5 years, p {\&}lt; 0.001; and 7.8 years, p {\&}lt; 0.002, respectively). These data support a role for HLA class I alleles in susceptibility to and age at onset of T1D.},

The T cell-driven autoimmune response is initiated by environmental triggers which are influenced by the state of intestinal homeostasis and the microbiota. The disease process can be separated into two phases: firstly, initiation of mild, controlled, long-term infiltration and secondly, propagation of invasive inflammation which quickly progresses to beta cell deletion and autoimmune diabetes. In this review, we will discuss the cellular and molecular triggers that might be required for these two phases in the context of other issues including the unique anatomical location of pancreas, the location of T cell priming, the requirements for islet entry, and the events that ultimately drive beta cell destruction and the onset of diabetes.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Reverse engineering gene regulatory networks, especially large size networks from time series gene expression data, remain a challenge to the systems biology community. In this article, a new hybrid algorithm integrating ordinary differential equation models with dynamic Bayesian network analysis, called Differential Equation-based Local Dynamic Bayesian Network (DELDBN), was proposed and implemented for gene regulatory network inference.

RESULTS:The performance of DELDBN was benchmarked with an in vivo dataset from yeast. DELDBN significantly improved the accuracy and sensitivity of network inference compared with other approaches. The local causal discovery algorithm implemented in DELDBN also reduced the complexity of the network inference algorithm and improved its scalability to infer larger networks. We have demonstrated the applicability of the approach to a network containing thousands of genes with a dataset from human HeLa cell time series experiments. The local network around BRCA1 was particularly investigated and validated with independent published studies. BRAC1 network was significantly enriched with the known BRCA1-relevant interactions, indicating that DELDBN can effectively infer large size gene regulatory network from time series data.

abstract = {Diabetes in NOD mice represents the end stage of a genetically-programmed autoimmune process mediated by T lymphocytes and directed against insulin-producing $\beta$ cells. We have shown in a previous study that the course of the disease is significantly inhibited in NOD mice which have been made tolerant at birth to foreign histocompatibility antigens. This early T cell manipulation results in a significant delay of disease onset, reduced overall incidence and less severe alterations of islet cells. In order to characterize better the nature of the foreign tolerogenic determinants responsible for this protection, we have now examined separately the contribution of MHC and non-MHC antigens. Two lines of congenic mice were used as donors of tolerogenic cells, NOD.H-2b, which differ from NOD by the MHC-encoded antigens only, and B10.H-2g7, which differ by all the minor histocompatibility antigens encoded by the B10 background, but which share with NOD mice the same MHC haplotype. Our results show that NOD recipients of F1 semi-compatible cells become specifically tolerant to the set of alloantigens to which they were neonatally exposed. Unresponsiveness, assessed by lack of CTL generation, is profound and specific. Yet, despite the fact that distinct sets of alloreactive T cell precursors are silenced, mice made tolerant indifferently to major or minor histocompatibility antigens are significantly protected against overt diabetes. These results could mean that each set of MHC and non-MHC encoded determinants can independently cross-tolerize a sufficient proportion of the autoreactive repertoire to slow the natural course of the disease. Alternatively, neonatally-acquired tolerance might induce polyclonal activation of the immune system resulting in the suppression or the immunodeviation of potentially harmful, autoreactive T cell clones.},

abstract = {Thanks to recent advances in molecular biology, allied to an ever increasing amount of experimental data, the functional state of thousands of genes can now be extracted simultaneously by using methods such as cDNA microarrays and RNA-Seq. Particularly important related investigations are the modeling and identification of gene regulatory networks from expression data sets. Such a knowledge is fundamental for many applications, such as disease treatment, therapeutic intervention strategies and drugs design, as well as for planning high-throughput new experiments. Methods have been developed for gene networks modeling and identification from expression profiles. However, an important open problem regards how to validate such approaches and its results. This work presents an objective approach for validation of gene network modeling and identification which comprises the following three main aspects: (1) Artificial Gene Networks (AGNs) model generation through theoretical models of complex networks, which is used to simulate temporal expression data; (2) a computational method for gene network identification from the simulated data, which is founded on a feature selection approach where a target gene is fixed and the expression profile is observed for all other genes in order to identify a relevant subset of predictors; and (3) validation of the identified AGN-based network through comparison with the original network. The proposed framework allows several types of AGNs to be generated and used in order to simulate temporal expression data. The results of the network identification method can then be compared to the original network in order to estimate its properties and accuracy. Some of the most important theoretical models of complex networks have been assessed: the uniformly-random Erd{\"o}s-R{\'e}nyi (ER), the small-world Watts-Strogatz (WS), the scale-free Barab{\'a}si-Albert (BA), and geographical networks (GG). The experimental results indicate that the inference method was sensitive to average degree <k> variation, decreasing its network recovery rate with the increase of <k>. The signal size was important for the inference method to get better accuracy in the network identification rate, presenting very good results with small expression profiles. However, the adopted inference method was not sensible to recognize distinct structures of interaction among genes, presenting a similar behavior when applied to different network topologies. In summary, the proposed framework, though simple, was adequate for the validation of the inferred networks by identifying some properties of the evaluated method, which can be extended to other inference methods.},

abstract = {Objective To test the hypothesis that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are similar in nondiabetic (non-DM) adolescents compared with those with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the most insulin-sensitive (IS) tertile, and that CVD risk factors are more atherogenic with decreasing IS in adolescents with T1D. Study design IS for adolescents with T1D (n = 292; age = 15.4 $\pm$ 2.1 years; duration = 8.8 $\pm$ 3.0 years, hemoglobin A1c = 8.9% $\pm$ 1.6%) and non-DM controls (n = 89; age = 15.4 $\pm$ 2.1 years) was estimated using the model: logeIS = .64725 − 0.02032 (waist [cm]) − 0.09779 (hemoglobin A1c [%]) − 0.00235 (triglycerides [mg/dL]). CVD risk factors (blood pressure, fasting total and low- and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and body mass index z score) were compared between all non-DM adolescents and those with T1D in the most IS tertile, and then examined for a linear trend by IS tertile in adolescents with T1D, adjusted for sex, race/ethnicity, and Tanner stage. Results Estimated IS was significantly lower in adolescents with T1D compared with those without (T1D = 7.8 $\pm$ 2.4, non-DM = 11.5 $\pm$ 2.9; P {\&}lt; .0001). CVD risk factors were similar for non-DM compared with the adolescents with T1D with the most IS, except for higher (HDL-c) and diastolic blood pressure in adolescents with T1D (P {\&}lt; .05). Among adolescents with T1D, all CVD risk factors except for (HDL-c), were more atherogenic across decreasing IS tertiles in linear regression analysis (P {\&}lt; .05). Conclusion Adolescents with T1D who are the most IS have similar CVD risk factors compared with non-DM adolescents. CVD risk factors are inversely associated with IS in adolescents with T1D. IS may be an important therapeutic target for reducing CVD risk factors in adolescents with T1D.},

abstract = {Recent advances in biotechnology have resulted in cytometers capable of performing numerous correlated measurements of cells, often exceeding ten. In the near future, it is likely that this number will increase by fivefold and perhaps even higher. Traditional analysis strategies based on examining one measurement versus another are not suitable for high-dimensional data analysis because the number of measurement combinations expands geometrically with dimension, forming a kind of complexity barrier. This dimensionality barrier limits cytometry and other technologies from reaching their maximum potential in visualizing and analyzing important information embedded in high-dimensional data.This chapter describes efforts to break through this barrier and allow the visualization and analysis of any number of measurements with a new paradigm called Probability State Modeling (PSM). This new system creates a virtual progression variable based on probability that relates all measurements. PSM can produce a single graph that conveys more information about a sample than hundreds of traditional histograms. These PSM overlays reveal the rich interplay of phenotypic changes in cells as they differentiate. The end result is a deeper appreciation of the molecular genetic underpinnings of ontological processes in complex populations such as found in bone marrow and peripheral blood.Eventually these models will help investigators better understand normal and abnormal cellular progressions and will be a valuable general tool for the analysis and visualization of high-dimensional data.},

The package, which is tightly integrated with other Bioconductor software for analysis of flow cytometry, provides tools to transform raw flow cytometry data into a form suitable for direct input into conventional statistical analysis and empirical modeling software tools. The approach of flowFP is to generate a description of the multivariate probability distribution function of flow cytometry data in the form of a "fingerprint." As such, it is independent of a presumptive functional form for the distribution, in contrast with model-based methods such as Gaussian Mixture Modeling. FlowFP is computationally efficient and able to handle extremely large flow cytometry data sets of arbitrary dimensionality. Algorithms and software implementation of the package are described. Use of the software is exemplified with applications to data quality control and to the automated classification of Acute Myeloid Leukemia.},

abstract = {Recent technological advances in flow cytometry instrumentation provide the basis for high-dimensionality and high-throughput biological experimentation in a heterogeneous cellular context. Concomitant advances in scalable computational algorithms are necessary to better utilize the information that is contained in these high-complexity experiments. The development of such tools has the potential to expand the utility of flow cytometric analysis from a predominantly hypothesis-driven mode to one of discovery, or hypothesis-generating research. A new method of analysis of flow cytometric data called Cytometric Fingerprinting (CF) has been developed. CF captures the set of multivariate probability distribution functions corresponding to list-mode data and then "flattens" them into a computationally efficient fingerprint representation that facilitates quantitative comparisons of samples. An experimental and synthetic data were generated to act as reference sets for evaluating CF. Without the introduction of prior knowledge, CF was able to "discover" the location and concentration of spiked cells in ungated analyses over a concentration range covering four orders of magnitude, to a lower limit on the order of 10 spiked events in a background of 100,000 events. We describe a new method for quantitative analysis of list-mode cytometric data. CF includes a novel algorithm for space subdivision that improves estimation of the probability density function by dividing space into nonrectangular polytopes. Additionally it renders a multidimensional distribution in the form of a one-dimensional multiresolution hierarchical fingerprint that creates a computationally efficient representation of high dimensionality distribution functions. CF supports both the generation and testing of hypotheses, eliminates sources of operator bias, and provides an increased level of automation of data analysis.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which a T-cell-mediated attack destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreatic islets. Despite insulin supplementation severe complications ask for novel treatments that aim at cure or delay of the onset of the disease. In spontaneous animal models for diabetes like the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, distinct steps in the pathogenesis of the disease can be distinguished. In the past 10 years it became evident that DC and macrophages play an important role in all three phases of the pathogenesis of T1D. In phase 1, dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages accumulate at the islet edges. In phase 2, DC and macrophages are involved in the activation of autoreactive T cells that accumulate in the pancreas. In the third phase the islets are invaded by macrophages, DC and NK cells followed by the destruction of the beta-cells. Recent data suggest a role for a new member of the DC family: the plasmacytoid DC (pDC). pDC have been found to induce tolerance in experimental models of asthma. Several studies in humans and the NOD mouse support a similar role for pDC in diabetes. Mechanisms found to be involved in tolerance induction by pDC are inhibition of effector T cells, induction of regulatory T cells, production of cytokines and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). The exact mechanism of tolerance induction by pDC in diabetes remains to be established but the intrinsic tolerogenic properties of pDC provide a promising, yet underestimated target for therapeutic intervention.},

Our findings suggest that MBL2 functional SNPs are more closely related to AITD than to T1D, being MBL2 SNPs frequencies in T1D patients not affected by AITD comparable to the HC ones, while significantly different between AITD patients and patients not affected by the disease. Thus, the association between MBL2 polymorphisms and T1D that we previously reported, seems to result from the stronger association of MBL2 SNPs with another autoimmune disease, the AITD, frequently associated with T1D.},

abstract = {Prevention of type 1 diabetes mellitus requires early intervention in the autoimmune process directed against $\beta$ cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. This autoimmune inflammatory process is thought to be caused by the effect of Th1 cells and their secreted cytokines (e.g. interferon) and to be suppressed by Th2-secreted anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-4, IL-10). Various methods aimed specifically at halting or modulating this response have been attempted. An alternative method is the re-induction of tolerance towards the putative self antigen that causes the disease. Proposed antigens such as insulin, glutamic acid decarboxilase (GAD) and the heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60)-derived peptide 277 have been used successfully in murine diabetes models and in initial clinical trials in early diabetes patients. Here, we review the results of these trials.},

abstract = {Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. and preventing smoking initiation among adolescents is a public health priority and a central element of comprehensive tobacco control. While cigarette smoking is harmful to all youths, those with special healthcare needs are particularly vulnerable to the negative health consequences of smoking, and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) urgently stand out as a high-risk group. Available literature suggests the prevalence and risk factors for smoking among adolescents with T1D are strikingly similar to the general population. Moreover, smoking negatively affects T1D management and increases risk for and progression of adverse health outcomes related to T1D. Adolescents with T1D are also influenced by disease-related social and behavioral factors that affect decisions about smoking. Pediatric health care providers (HCPs) are optimally-positioned to screen and counsel adolescents with T1D to avoid smoking, as they have well-established relationships with young patients and regularly scheduled visits surrounding T1D management. However, several barriers inhibit HCPs from screening/counseling adolescents with T1D for smoking on a regular basis. Well-established strategies for behavioral counseling for smoking in the healthcare setting may be effective to prevent and reduce smoking among adolescents with T1D. HCPs who care for these young patients can tailor proven counseling approaches to the context of T1D to address smoking alongside other behavioral factors that are central to disease management. Empirical research is also needed to inform the development and deployment of healthcare-based interventions and maximize their impact within this population.},

However, the berberine effect on serum glucose levels in type 1 diabetes (T1D) subjects still remains unknown. This study investigated berberine's effects on serum glucose levels using non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice that spontaneously develop T1D. The NOD mice were randomly divided into four groups, administered water with 50, 150, and 500{\&}{\#}xa0;mg berberine/kg bw, respectively, through 14{\&}{\#}xa0;weeks. ICR mice were also selected as a species control group to compare with the NOD mice. Changes in body weight, oral glucose challenge, and serum glucose levels were determined to identify the protective effect of berberine on T1D. After the 14-week oral supplementation, berberine decreased fasting serum glucose levels in NOD mice close to the levels in normal ICR mice in a dose dependent manner. Serum berberine levels showed a significantly (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05) negative and non-linear correlation with fasting glucose levels in berberine-administered NOD mice. Our results suggested that berberine supplemented at appropriate doses for 14{\&}{\#}xa0;weeks did not cause toxic side effects, but improved hyperglycemia in NOD mice.},

The functional impact of CNV cannot be fully captured through linkage disequilibrium with SNPs. These observations motivate the development of statistical methods for performing direct CNV association studies. We show through simulation that current tests for CNV association are prone to false-positive associations in the presence of differential errors between cases and controls, especially if quantitative CNV measurements are noisy. We present a statistical framework for performing case-control CNV association studies that applies likelihood ratio testing of quantitative CNV measurements in cases and controls. We show that our methods are robust to differential errors and noisy data and can achieve maximal theoretical power. We illustrate the power of these methods for testing for association with binary and quantitative traits, and have made this software available as the R package CNVtools.},

abstract = {At the onset of type 1 diabetes, most of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells are destroyed by effector cells, and therefore, the following two factors, at a minimum, are necessary for ``reversing'' hyperglycemia in autoimmune diabetes; depletion of effector cells and enhancement of beta cell regeneration. In this study, we tried a novel approach for ``reversing'' autoimmune diabetes in a murine model. Here we show that remission could be achieved with a combination therapy of a single injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and a single intraperitoneal injection of a pancreatic beta cell line, MIN6N-9a, in recent-onset diabetic NOD (non-obese diabetic) mice. Five out of seven mice (71%) receiving MIN6N-9a and CFA became normoglycemic within 120 days after treatment, whereas only two of nine (22%) receiving vehicle instead of MIN6N-9a achieved remission. Histological examination of pancreatic specimens from ``reversed'' mice showed decreased islet number, but each islet was markedly hyperplastic; being about six times larger than those from controls. Although it has been reported that hematopoietic cells such as splenocytes differentiate into insulin-producing cells and play a key role, our data indicate that they are not an absolute requirement for the ``reversal'' of autoimmune diabetes.},

abstract = {The study of normal or malignant haematopoiesis requires the analysis of heterogeneous cell populations using multiple morphological and molecular criteria. Flow cytometry has the capacity to acquire multi-parameter information of large haematopoietic cell populations, utilizing various combinations of >200 molecular markers (clusters of differentiation, CD). However, current flow cytometry analyses are based on serial gating of two-parametric scatter plots--a process that is inherently incapable to discriminate all subgroups of cells in the data. Here we studied the cellular diversity of normal bone marrows (BM) using multi-dimensional cluster analysis of six-parametric flow cytometry data (four CD, forward scatter and side scatter), focusing mainly on the myeloid lineage. Twenty-three subclasses of cells were resolved, many of them inseparable even when examined in all possible two-parametric scatter plots. The multi-dimensional analysis could distinguish the haematopoietic progenitors according to International Society of Haematotherapy and Graft Engineering criteria from other types of immature cells. Based on the defined clusters, we designed a classifier that assigns BM cells in samples to subclasses based on robust six-dimensional position and extended shape. The analysis presented here can manage successfully both the increasing numbers of haematopoietic cellular markers and sample heterogeneity. This should enhance the ability to study normal haematopoiesis, and to identify and monitor haematopoietic disorders.},

Leptin-deficient and leptin-resistant diabetic obese mice have enlarged, hypomotile gallbladders. In addition, bile from gallbladders of leptin-deficient mice has enhanced cholesterol crystal formation, whereas bile from gallbladders of leptin-resistant mice has delayed crystal observation time. To determine the effect of diabetes alone, we hypothesized that leptin-normal, nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice would have reduced biliary motility and rapid crystal formation. Twenty control and 9 prediabetic and 11 diabetic NOD, 12- to 26-week-old mice underwent glucose measurement and cholecystectomy for muscle bath stimulation with neurotransmitters. An additional group of 200 control and 78 NOD 12-week-old mice underwent microscopic bile examination for cholesterol crystal formation. Compared with control mice, prediabetic NOD mice had similar glucose levels and gallbladder volumes. Diabetic NOD mice had higher sugar levels and larger gallbladder volumes (P {\&}lt; 0.001) than control mice. Prediabetic NOD gallbladders had less contractility (P {\&}lt; 0.01) than control gallbladders, and contractility worsened (P {\&}lt; 0.01) in diabetic NOD mice. NOD mice formed cholesterol crystals earlier than did control mice (P {\&}lt; 0.05). Nonobese diabetic NOD mice have (1) decreased gallbladder contraction to neurotransmitters, which worsens with development of diabetes, and (2) rapid crystal formation. We conclude that diabetes alone alters gallbladder motility and cholesterol crystal formation.},

Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

Consistency properties of the Box-Cox estimates (MLE's) of $\lambda$ and the parameters in the linear model, as well as the asymptotic variances of these estimates, are considered. We find that in some structured models such as transformed linear regression with small to moderate error variances, the asymptotic variances of the estimates of the parameters in the linear model are much larger when the transformation parameter $\lambda$ is unknown than when it is known. In some unstructured models such as transformed one-way analysis of variance with moderate to large error variances, the cost of not knowing $\lambda$ is moderate to small. The case where the error distribution in the linear model is not normal but actually unknown is considered, and robust methods in the presence of transformations are introduced for this case. Asymptotics and simulation results for the transformed additive two-way layout show that much is gained by this robustification of the Box-Cox methods when the ratios of the means to the error standard deviation are moderate to large. However, the performance of all Box-Cox type procedures is unstable and highly dependent on the parameters of the model in structured models with small to moderate error variances.},

abstract = {Recent genetic mapping and gene-phenotype studies have revealed the genetic architecture of type 1 diabetes. At least ten genes so far can be singled out as strong causal candidates. The known functions of these genes indicate the primary etiological pathways of this disease, including HLA class II and I molecules binding to preproinsulin peptides and T cell receptors, T and B cell activation, innate pathogen-viral responses, chemokine and cytokine signaling, and T regulatory and antigen-presenting cell functions. This review considers research in the field of type 1 diabetes toward identifying disease mechanisms using genetic approaches. The expression and functions of these pathways, and, therefore, disease susceptibility, will be influenced by epigenetic and environmental factors. Certain inherited immune phenotypes will be early precursors of type 1 diabetes and could be useful in future clinical trials.},

abstract = {We propose a hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric mixture model for clustering when some of the covariates are assumed to be of varying relevance to the clustering problem. This can be thought of as an issue in variable selection for unsupervised learning. We demonstrate that by defining a hierarchical population based nonparametric prior on the cluster locations scaled by the inverse covariance matrices of the likelihood we arrive at a 'sparsity prior' representation which admits a conditionally conjugate prior. This allows us to perform full Gibbs sampling to obtain posterior distributions over parameters of interest including an explicit measure of each covariate's relevance and a distribution over the number of potential clusters present in the data. This also allows for individual cluster specific variable selection. We demonstrate improved inference on a number of canonical problems.},

Here we examined IA-2A affinity and epitope specificity to assess heterogeneity in response intensity in relation to pathogenesis and diabetes risk in 50 children who were prospectively followed from birth. At first IA-2A appearance, affinity ranged from 107 to 1011{\&}{\#}xa0;L/mol and was high ({\&}gt;{\&}{\#}xa0;1.0{\&}{\#}xa0;×{\&}{\#}xa0;109{\&}{\#}xa0;L/mol) in 41 (82%) children. IA-2A affinity was not associated with epitope specificity or HLA class II haplotype. On follow-up, affinity increased or remained high, and IA-2A were commonly against epitopes within the protein tyrosine phosphatase-like IA-2 domain and the homologue protein IA-2$\beta$. IA-2A were preceded or accompanied by other islet autoantibodies in 49 (98%) children, of which 34 progressed to diabetes. IA-2A affinity did not stratify diabetes risk. In conclusion, the IA-2A response in children is intense with rapid maturation against immunogenic epitopes and a strong association with diabetes development.},

abstract = {In type 1 diabetes, insulin producing pancreatic $\beta$-cells are attacked and destroyed by autoreactive T cells, which causes major impairments of blood glucose metabolism and finally development of life-threatening complications. Currently, the treatment of this devastating disease is based on the substitution of insulin and thus can be considered palliative. Curative treatment approaches by contrast need to target the underlying causes of disease development: in this case, the autoreactive immune system and the loss of active $\beta$-cell mass. In recent years, several clinical trials have been performed studying the effects of diverse immunomodulating agents in order to halt the autoreactive immune response or finding paths to repopulate $\beta$-cell mass that could restore euglycemia. While some of the treatments showed remarkable outcomes, most of the studies failed to improve the course of disease. The reason might be that none of the candidates currently under investigation are potent enough at tolerable dosages to hold the key for the cure. Subsequently, the idea of combining defined substances has evolved in order to detect synergistic effects and improve the strength of the therapeutic potential. Observations from mouse models and clinical experience from various other diseases where combination therapies often constitute the standard treatment strongly support this hypothesis. Here, we discuss promising monotherapeutic approaches, summarize current clinical trials and propose a rationale on how to prioritize different combinations of treatments.},

abstract = {Background: Identifying all protein complexes in an organism is a major goal of systems biology. In the past 18 months, the results of two genome-scale tandem affinity purification-mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) assays in yeast have been published, along with corresponding complex maps. For most complexes, the published data sets were surprisingly uncorrelated. It is therefore useful to consider the raw data from each study and generate an accurate complex map from a high-confidence data set that integrates the results of these and earlier assays.Results: Using an unsupervised probabilistic scoring scheme, we assigned a confidence score to each interaction in the matrix-model interpretation of the large-scale yeast mass-spectrometry data sets. The scoring metric proved more accurate than the filtering schemes used in the original data sets. We then took a high-confidence subset of these interactions and derived a set of complexes using MCL. The complexes show high correlation with existing annotations. Hierarchical organization of some protein complexes is evident from inter-complex interactions.Conclusion: We demonstrate that our scoring method can generate an integrated high-confidence subset of observed matrix-model interactions, which we subsequently used to derive an accurate map of yeast complexes. Our results indicate that essentiality is a product of the protein complex rather than the individual protein, and that we have achieved near saturation of the yeast high-abundance, rich-media-expressed "complex-ome."},

abstract = {Summary Dendritic cell (DC)-based tumor immunotherapy is widely known to elicit protective anti-tumor immune responses, although the safety and effectiveness have yet to be thoroughly explored. We reported that a disruption in the stratum corneum barrier resulted in enhanced permeability and alterations in the skin immune system in such a way that epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) functioned as vigorous antigen presenters for T helper (Th) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In both human and murine models, topical application of melanoma-associated antigen peptides onto stratum corneum barrier-disrupted skin, specifically induced tumoricidal immune responses in vivo and in vitro accompanying an increased expression of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules on LCs. In addition, for reasons of simplicity, safety and effectiveness, percutaneous peptide application has demonstrated a certain degree of feasibility in clinical approach in patients with melanoma. In the future, resolution of some of the outstanding issues concerning the selection of the most effective adjuvants in combination with barrier disruption and depletion of regulatory T (Treg) cell-mediated immune suppression would appear as essential to improve percutaneous melanoma immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Cells are controlled by the complex and dynamic actions of thousands of genes. With the sequencing of many genomes, the key problem has shifted from identifying genes to knowing what the genes do; we need a framework for expressing that knowledge. Even the most rigorous attempts to construct ontological frameworks describing gene function (e.g., the Gene Ontology project) ultimately rely on manual curation and are thus labor-intensive and subjective. But an alternative exists: the field of functional genomics is piecing together networks of gene interactions, and although these data are currently incomplete and error-prone, they provide a glimpse of a new, probabilistic view of gene function. We outline such a framework, which revolves around a statistical description of gene interactions derived from large, systematically compiled data sets. In this probabilistic view, pleiotropy is implicit, all data have errors and the definition of gene function is an iterative process that ultimately converges on the correct functions. The relationships between the genes are defined by the data, not by hand. Even this comprehensive view fails to capture key aspects of gene function, not least their dynamics in time and space, showing that there are limitations to the model that must ultimately be addressed.},

abstract = {Oral administration of autoantigens to adult mice is an effective means of suppressing experimental autoimmune diseases including diabetes and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Different mechanisms are involved in induction of oral tolerance including active suppression, anergy and deletion. Oral tolerance is generally not inducible in the neonatal period and we previously found that EAE development in Lewis rats is enhanced when animals are fed myelin antigens as neonates. Here we report the unexpected finding that oral administration of either human insulin or the insulin B-chain peptide (10--24) in the neonatal period suppresses the development of diabetes in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. Furthermore, suppression of diabetes by neonatal oral human insulin was more effective than oral human insulin given to NOD mice (3--4 weeks of age). No protection against EAE was observed in NOD mice neonatally fed PLP (48--70) or MOG (35--55) peptide prior to EAE induction, whereas adult NOD mice orally tolerized to these peptides were protected against EAE. Neonatal administration of insulin B-chain peptide also suppressed cyclophosphamide induced diabetes in the NOD whereas oral insulin administration to 4-week-old NOD mice had no effect, suggesting that the mechanism of disease suppression in the neonate involved anergy or deletion. Our findings that neonatal feeding of human insulin or insulin B-chain peptide is effective in inhibiting diabetes when given to the NOD mouse may have applications in preventing diabetes in high risk human populations.},

Study design This was a retrospective chart review of patients hospitalized at diagnosis with T1D from 1990 to 1999 in a children's hospital. Results A total of 247 children were hospitalized, 44% of whom presented in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). When stratified by 2-year age intervals, only total carbon dioxide (tCO2) was significantly lower in the youngest children (P = .02), and the duration of candidiasis was significantly longer in those children presenting in DKA (P = .004). Parents were more likely to recognize symptomatic hyperglycemia in children older than 2 years (P {\&}lt; .0001). Most parents sought care for their child suspecting that the child had diabetes; the other children were diagnosed when presenting with another concern. Only gender and tCO2 were significantly correlated with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c); age-adjusted HbA1c was 0.64% higher in girls compared with boys (P = .045), and each 1-mmol/L decrement in tCO2 increased the age- and gender-adjusted HbA1c by 0.086% (P {\&}lt; .001). Conclusions A high proportion of children under age 6 years present critically ill at the diagnosis of T1D. When any of the classic symptoms of diabetes or a yeast infection is present, a serum glucose level should be measured.},

The cause of this rise is unknown, but epidemiological studies suggest the involvement of environmental factors, and viral infections in particular. Data demonstrating a cause-and-effect relationship between microbial infections and type 1 diabetes and how viruses may cause disease in humans are currently lacking. However, new evidence from animal models supports the hypothesis that viruses induce disease via mechanisms linked with innate immune upregulation. In the BioBreeding Diabetes Resistant rat, infection with a parvovirus induces islet destruction via upregulation of the toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signaling pathway. Data from mouse models of diabetes implicate TLR2, TLR3, and TLR7 in the disease process. Understanding the link between environmental agents and innate immune pathways involved in early stages of diabetes may advance the design of immune interventions to prevent disease in genetically susceptible individuals.},

We hypothesized that the genetic predisposition is multiplicative and joint risk of different diabetic phenotypes forms by distinct combination of susceptibility loci. Methods An ethnically homogenous population of Estonian origin, including 65 LADA patients, 154 patients with T1D, 260 patients with T2D and 229 non-diabetic controls, was genotyped for polymorphisms/haplotypes in HLA-DQB1, insulin gene (rs689, rs3842729), PHTF1--PTPN22 region (rs2476601, rs6679677), CTLA4 region (rs231806, rs16840252, rs5742909, rs231775, rs3087243, rs2033171), ICOS region (rs10932037, rs4675379), CD25 (rs706778), CD226(rs763361), NAA25 (rs17696736). Results As expected, the risk of T1D was consistently attributed by HLA-DQB1 haplotypes, but also by haplotypes of INS and PHTF1--PTPN22 region, and rs17696736 in NAA25. By contrast, LADA was associated only with T1D-protective HLA haplotypes and with two more frequent haplotypes of the CTLA4. It is of interest, that seldom CT haplotype of PHTF1--PTPN22 region carried the risk for autoantibody-negative T2D. The final best-fitted model for T1D genetic risk contained six gene regions (HLA-DQB1, INS, PHTF1, CTLA4 +{\&}{\#}xa0;49, CD226 and NAA25) and for LADA only two (HLA-DQB1 and CTLA4 +{\&}{\#}xa0;49). The AUCs of these models are 0.869 and 0.693, respectively. Conclusions Classical T1D-risk haplotypes of HLA and some non-HLA loci describe quite well the genetic risk for T1D but not for LADA. The need of further studies should be stressed to discover the real risk factors for slower forms of autoimmune diabetes in adults.},

Recently, a controversy has surfaced about whether Treg cells are overwhelmingly stable, or if they can be reprogrammed in inflammatory and autoimmune environments. Those in the instability camp have shown that a fraction of Treg cells lose forkhead box P3 protein and acquire effector arm activities. Instability is coupled with interleukin-2 insufficiency and the inflammatory milieu that promotes reprogramming. Here, we highlight the basic tenets of each viewpoint and discuss technical, biological and environmental differences in the models that might help yield a unifying hypothesis. Also considered is how Treg cell instability could link to development of autoimmune disease and the implications for trials of Treg cell-based therapy.},

abstract = {Anti-insulin autoimmunity is one of the primary forces in initiating and progressing $\beta$-cell destruction in type 1 diabetes. While insulin expression in thymic medullary epithelial cells has been shown to be essential for establishing $\beta$-cell central tolerance, the function of insulin expression in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of hematopoietic lineage remains elusive. With a Cre-lox reporter approach, we labeled Aire-expressing cells with enhanced yellow fluorescent proteins, and found that insulin expression in the spleen was restricted predominantly to a population of Aire+CD11cintB220+ dendritic cells (DCs). Targeted insulin deletion in APCs failed to induce anti-islet autoimmunity in B6 mice. In contrast, elevated levels of T cell infiltration into islets were observed in B6g7 congenic mice when insulin was specifically deleted in their CD11c-expressing DCs (B6g7·CD11c-$\Delta$Ins mice). Thus, insulin expression in BM-derived, Aire+ tolerogenic DCs may play an essential role to prevent the activation and expansion of insulin-reactive T cells in the periphery.},

Recently, the application of both microarrays and NGS has expanded to include microRNAs (miRNAs), but the relative performance of these methods has not been rigorously characterized. We analyzed three biological samples across six miRNA microarray platforms and compared their hybridization performance. We examined the utility of these platforms, as well as NGS, for the detection of differentially expressed miRNAs. We then validated the results for 89 miRNAs by real-time RT-PCR and challenged the use of this assay as a "gold standard." Finally, we implemented a novel method to evaluate false-positive and false-negative rates for all methods in the absence of a reference method.},

The PhoP/PhoQ two-component system of Salmonella typhimurium contributes to virulence by co-ordinating the adaptation to low concentrations of environmental Mg2+. Limiting concentrations of extracellular Mg2+ activate the PhoP/PhoQ phosphorylation cascade modulating the transcription of PhoP-regulated genes. In contrast, high concentrations of extracellular Mg2+ stimulate the dephosphorylation of the response regulator PhoP by the PhoQ kinase sensor. In the present study, we report the purification and functional reconstitution of PhoQ(His), a PhoQ variant with a C-terminal His tag, into Escherichia coli liposomes. The functionality of PhoQ(His) was essentially similar to that of PhoQ as shown in vivo and in vitro. Purified PhoQ(His) was inserted into liposomes in a unidirectional orientation, with the sensory domain facing the lumen and the catalytic domain facing the extraluminal environment. Reconstituted PhoQ(His) exhibited all the catalytic activities that have been described for histidine kinase sensors. Reconstituted PhoQ(His) was capable of autokinase activity when incubated in the presence of Mg2+-ATP. The phosphoryl group could be transferred from reconstituted PhoQ(His) to PhoP. Reconstituted PhoQ(His) catalysed the dephosphorylation of phospho-PhoP and this activity was stimulated by the addition of extraluminal ADP.},

Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain induction of autoimmunity by infection but it seems that three possibilities may be important in individuals susceptible to developing autoimmune disease: molecular mimicry (perhaps to retroviruses); polyclonal T cell activation (by an endogenous superantigen or an infecting organism); and MHC class II antigen induction. It seems reasonable that all three mechanisms operate together or separately in different individuals. Data continue to accumulate in favour of infectious agents being important initiators of autoimmune disease.},

abstract = {The role of historical contingency in evolution has been much debated, but rarely tested. Twelve initially identical populations of Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for >30,000 generations, although each population tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using (Cit+) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations, causing an increase in population size and diversity. The long-delayed and unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these hypotheses in experiments that "replayed" evolution from different points in that population's history. We observed no Cit+ mutants among 8.4 x 10(12) ancestral cells, nor among 9 x 10(12) cells from 60 clones sampled in the first 15,000 generations. However, we observed a significantly greater tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+, indicating that some potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations. This potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but did not cause generalized hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of this phenotype was contingent on the particular history of that population. More generally, we suggest that historical contingency is especially important when it facilitates the evolution of key innovations that are not easily evolved by gradual, cumulative selection.},

For this purpose, we performed both histological and immunocytochemical examinations of pancreata retrieved from mice at 2 through 30 weeks of age. An overexpression of la antigens was identified on islet $\beta$ cells at 4 weeks of age, without evidence of mononuclear cell infiltration. The abnormal expression of la antigens was age-related and was associated with hyperexpression of class I antigens and progressive islet cell histologic damage after 17 weeks of age. Immunocytochemical examination of islet cell infiltrate showed that the number of macrophages did not increase during the early phase of islet cell damage in these mice. The L3T4Lyt-2 ratio increased after 7 weeks of age, but was 1:1 in the late stage of insulitis. These findings suggest that widespread islet $\beta$-cell destruction is a process that begins primarily with derangements of the pancreatic $\beta$-cell immune pattern, which may trigger a mononuclear cell reaction.},

Here, we review the markers that provide evidence for immunological checkpoint failure and that also provide tools for assessment of individualized disease risk. When viewed in the context of genetic variation that influences immune response thresholds, progression from susceptibility to overt disease displays predictable modalities of clinical presentation resulting from a sequential series of failed homeostatic checkpoints for selection and activation of immunity.},

In this study, we found that B cells from PanLN of 3--4-week-old female NOD mice expressed high levels of $\alpha$4 integrin and LFA-1 and intermediate levels of $\beta$7 integrin; half of B cells were L-selectinhigh. In short-term in vivo lymphocyte migration assays, B cells migrated from the bloodstream into PanLN more efficiently than into peripheral LNs. Moreover, antibodies to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) and $\alpha$4$\beta$7 integrin inhibited {\&}gt;90% of B cell migration into PanLN. In contrast, antibodies to peripheral node addressin, L-selectin or LFA-1 partially inhibited B cell migration into PanLN. Furthermore, one intraperitoneal injection of anti-MAdCAM-1 antibody into 3-week-old NOD mice significantly inhibited entry of B cells into PanLN for at least 2 weeks. Taken together, these results indicate that the $\alpha$4$\beta$7 integrin/MAdCAM-1 adhesion pathway plays a predominant role in migration of B cells into PanLN in NOD mice. Thus, specific blockage of $\alpha$4$\beta$7 integrin/MAdCAM-1 adhesion pathway-mediated B cell migration may be a potential treatment for T1D.},

abstract = {Despite a large body of evidence describing associations between viruses and the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in genetically prone individuals, clearly defining causative infectious agents has not been successful. A likely explanation is that the link between infections and autoimmunity is more multifaceted than we initially assumed. Viral footprints might be hard to detect systemically or in the target organ once autoimmunity has been initiated, and several infections might have to act in concert to precipitate clinical autoimmunity. Furthermore, cells cross-reactive between viral and self-antigens might express low avidity T cell receptors and only be present transiently in the blood of affected individuals. In addition, there are two new observations from animal models that we should take into account at this point: first, viral infections alone might not be able to induce disease in the absence of other inflammatory factors (supporting the ``fertile field hypothesis'' [M.G. von Herrath et al., Microorganisms and autoimmunity: making the barren field fertile? Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 1 (2003) 151--157, [1]]). Second, increasing evidence indicates that viruses can play a role in preventing rather than enhancing T1D development (supporting the ``hygiene hypothesis'' [J.F. Bach, Protective role of infections and vaccinations on autoimmune diseases. J. Autoimmun. 16 (2001) 347--353]). In this article we will present an overview of the early events and requirements that could account for T1D predisposition and development, and explain how these can be modulated by viral infections. Focusing on coxsackie B and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections, we will discuss new data that can hopefully help us understand how virus-induced inflammation can positively or negatively affect the clinical outcome of islet-autoimmunity and T1D.},

abstract = {Protein modifications and the accumulation of those proteins are implicated in a host of diseases from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's to both insulin independent and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Accumulation of irreversibly modified proteins occurs when the degradation rate of proteins is reduced or the rate of modification increases. Although the synthesis rates of individual proteins in vivo have been extensively studied the methodology to measure degradation rates of individual proteins in vivo remains to be well developed. However, the ability to measure the relative age of a particular protein pool in relation to the quality of the pool (amount of damage) is a recent advance. This brief review describes a novel methodology to simultaneously measure the synthesis rate of individual proteins along with the accumulation of oxidative damage to those proteins in vivo. The results of a recent investigation on individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus are described. Accelerated damage to de novo synthesized ApoA-1 is shown during short-term insulin cessation, which has potential clinical implications. Future implications of the novel method in diabetes and aging are also discussed.},

abstract = {Following the request of the Directorate General of Health, a study was set up to assess conditions of use of insulin glargine in patients with diabetes in terms of actual practice in France, to describe the level of glycemic control and incidence of hypoglycaemia observed. This was a prospective, observational, multicenter, national monitoring over one year of a cohort of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated for at least a month with insulin glargine and followed for one year by general practitioners, diabetologists and pediatricians. The analysis focuses on 1707 patients, 609 patients with T1D and 1097 with T2D patients (type of diabetes was not specified for one patient). The average age of patients was 42.0 $\pm$ 19.4 years for T1D and 67.0 $\pm$ 11.9 years for T2D, 642 (58.5%) patients were aged 65 and older and 325 (29.6 %) aged 75 and over. The average duration of diabetes was respectively 15.8 $\pm$ 12.5 and 14.0 $\pm$ 8.8 years. Among patients with T2D, 57% were insulin naive before initiation of insulin glargine (T2D-IN) and 43% were already treated with insulin (T2D-IT). The reason for insulin glargine initiation was mainly poor glycemic control. The use of insulin glargine led to a significant increase in the use of the regimen basal-bolus in T1D and T2D-IT, from 32.0% to 84.7% and from 8.4% to 38.8% respectively and a decrease in the number of oral antidiabetic agents in T2D-IN, and patients aged over 65 years. The average dose of insulin glargine at baseline was 24.2 U/day in T1D, 31.6 U/day in T2D-IT and 23.6 U/day in T2D-IN. During follow-up, this dose was stable for T1D and increased in T2D (up to 35 U/day for T2D-IT and 29.7 U/day for T2D-IN). The proportion of patients achieving glycemic goal (HbA1c {\&}lt;7%) increased from 17.2% to 29.5% (T1D) from 19.9% to 33.4% (T2D-IT) and from 13.9% to 39.1% (TD2-IN). Weight gain, meanwhile, was 0.6-0.7kg for T2D and 0.8kg for T1D. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia per 100 patient-years was 127 for T1D, 11 for T2D. For 85.7% of patients, no episode of severe hypoglycemia has been reported during follow-up. Similar results were obtained in 642 patients with T2D aged over 65 years. In conclusion, the results of this study in real life condition showed a usage profile of insulin glargine in France conforms to joint HAS and AFSSAPS good use and recommendations for management of diabetic patient. Glycemic control improved initially following the introduction of insulin glargine and was maintained during the 12-month follow-up. An increasing number of patients reaching HbA1c ({\&}lt;7%) target was observed, with no increase in severe hypoglycemia, and a minor weight gain. These results, obtained with insulin glargine in real practice conditions, corroborate those found in clinical trials and provide a strong complement to studies evaluating the benefit/risk ratio.},

abstract = {NOD mice have a relative deficiency of CD4+CD25+regulatory T cells that could result in an inability to maintain peripheral tolerance. The aim of this study was to induce the generation of CD4+CD25+regulatory T cells in response to autoantigens to prevent type 1 diabetes (T1D). We found that immunization of NOD mice with insulin B-chain peptide B:9--23 followed by 72 h in vitro culture with B:9--23 peptide induces generation of CD4+CD25+regulatory T cells. Route of immunization has a critical role in the generation of these cells. Non-autoimmune mice BALB/c, C57BL/6 and NOR did not show up regulation of CD4+CD25+regulatory T cells. These cells secreted large amounts of TGF-$\beta$ and TNF-$\alpha$ with little or no IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-10. Adoptive transfer of these CD4+CD25+regulatory T cells into NOD--SCID mice completely prevented the adoptive transfer of disease by diabetogenic T cells. Although, non-self antigenic OVA (323--339) peptide immunization and in vitro culture with OVA (323--339) peptide does result in up regulation of CD4+CD25+T cells, these cells did not prevent transfer of diabetes. Our study for the first time identified the generation of antigen-specific CD4+CD25+regulatory T cells specifically in response to immunization with B:9--23 peptide in NOD mice that are capable of blocking adoptive transfer of diabetes. Our results suggest the possibility of using autoantigens to induce antigen-specific regulatory T cells to prevent and regulate autoimmune diabetes.},

abstract = {1,25(OH)2D3, the active form of vitamin D, is a central player in calcium and bone metabolism. More recently, important immunomodulatory effects have been attributed to this hormone. The widespread presence of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the immune system and the expression of the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the active 1,25(OH)2D3 regulated by specific immune signals, even suggest a paracrine immunomodulatory role for 1,25(OH)2D3. Additionally, the different molecular mechanisms used by 1,25(OH)2D3 to exert its immunomodulatory effects prove of a broad action radius for this compound. Both, the effects of vitamin D deficiency and/or absence of the VDR as well as intervention with pharmacological doses of 1,25(OH)2D3 or one of its less-calcemic analogs, affects immune system behavior in different animal models of immune-mediated disorders, such as type 1 diabetes. This review aims to summarize the data as they stand at the present time on the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated disorders, with special focus on type 1 diabetes, and on the therapeutic opportunities for vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of this autoimmune disease in mouse models and humans.},

abstract = {Clinical and laboratory data of 1248 newly diagnosed diabetic children at the time of diagnosis were analysed. All children were admitted to the University Children's Hospital in Sofia, 45.9% before first their insulin injection. Symptoms preceding the diagnosis and laboratory data (plasma glucose and ketonuria) were analysed, respectively for 1100 and 1022 children. Blood pH (mainly arterialized) was available in 558 ketonuria positive children and in other 82 acidotic breathing was reported. Mother's education was noted in the 1226 hospital records. Among the children with known urinanalysis 13.5% were without ketonuria (148 patients), 12 of them with fasting blood glucose ≤ 6.4 mmol/1 (115 mg/dl). Eighteen-point-two percent of all children were hospitalized in a state of severe ketoacidosis (blood pH ≤ 7.2 or reported acidotic breathing). The average duration of thirst and polyuria was 28 $\pm$ 33 days. Ketonuria negative children with plasma glucose ≤ 6.4 mmol/l showed a significantly shorter period of symptoms, compared to those with plasma glucose {\&}gt; 6.4 mmol/l (17 $\pm$ 25 vs. 25 $\pm$ 31 days; P = 0.0991). The cases with severe ketoacidosis, compared to those with mild ketoacidosis (blood pH 7.21--7.34) showed shorter period of symptoms too (P = 0.0658). Moderate positive relation existed between the age at diagnosis and duration of symptoms ($\chi$2 = 43.28, D.F. = 8, P = 0.0000). The percentage of severe ketoacidoses is higher in the younger age groups. Febrile illness, preceding the start of the symptoms was more common in the groups with shorter duration of symptoms (up to 1 month), but did not change the proportion of severe ketoacidoses. No significant difference was found between the level of mother's education and duration of the symptoms before diagnosis (P = 0.9782) We concluded that the level of metabolic disturbances at the diagnosis of IDDM among children was not influenced by the duration of the preceding symptoms. The severity of clinical picture was possibly dependent on the degree of insulinopenia, i.e. the rate of $\beta$-cell destruction. Clinical heterogeneity was possibly dependent on genetical heterogeneity related to HLA class II genes.},

abstract = {SummaryBackground Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic $\beta$ cells. The 60 kDa heat-shock protein (hsp60) is one of the known target self antigens. An immunomodulatory peptide from hsp60, p277, arrested $\beta$-cell destruction and maintained insulin production in newly diabetic NOD mice. We did a randomised, double-blind, phase II study of peptide treatment in patients with newly diagnosed ({\&}lt;6 months) type 1 diabetes. Methods 35 patients with type 1 diabetes and basal C-peptide concentrations above 0·1 nmol/L were assigned subcutaneous injections of 1 mg p277 and 40 mg mannitol in vegetable oil (DiaPep277; n=18) at entry, 1 month, and 6 months, or three placebo injections (mannitol in vehicle; placebo; n=17). The primary endpoint was glucagon-stimulated C-peptide production. Secondary endpoints were metabolic control and T-cell autoimmunity to hsp60 and to p277 (assayed by cytokine secretion). 31 patients completed 10 months of follow-up and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Findings At 10 months, mean C-peptide concentrations had fallen in the placebo group (n=16) but were maintained in the DiaPep277 group (n=15; 0·26 [SD 0·11] vs 0·93 [0·35] nmol/L; p=0·039). Need for exogenous insulin was higher in the placebo than in the DiaPep277 group (0·67 [0·33] vs 0·43 [0·17] U/kg; p=0·042). Haemoglobin A1c concentrations were low (around 7%) in both groups. T-cell reactivity to hsp60 and p277 in the DiaPep277 group showed an enhanced T‐helper‐2 cytokine phenotype. No adverse effects were noted. Interpretation Although this study was small, treatment of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes with DiaPep277 seems to preserve endogenous insulin production, perhaps through induction of a shift from T-helper-1 to T‐helper‐2 cytokines produced by the autoimmune T cells.},

Among seven NOD-related strains studied, the IIS mouse was found to possess a recombinant Idd10 interval with the same sequence at Fcgr1 as the NOD mouse, but a different sequence at Cd101 from that in the NOD mouse with 10 amino acid substitutions. The frequency of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice congenic for IIS Idd10 (NOD.IISIdd10) was significantly reduced as compared to that in the NOD mouse, despite the presence of the identical Fcgr1 sequence. These data indicate that IIS mice possess a resistant allele at Idd10, and suggest that Cd101, but not Fcgr1, is responsible for the Idd10 effect.},

Whilst islet transplantation combined with immune suppression has shown some efficacy, the availability of beta cells restricts its general use. Differentiation protocols directing cultured stem cells into pancreatic tissue are under development.

We purified pancreatic T lymphocytes from the NOD mouse for comparative phenotypic and functional analysis with T lymphocytes from spleen, peripheral blood and regional lymph nodes. Pancreatic T lymphocytes from NOD-Wehi mice, which have an incidence of spontaneous diabetes of {\&}lt;5%, had a CD4:CD8 ratio of 1.25 $\pm$ 0.23 compared with 2.44 $\pm$ 0.31 for peripheral blood lymphocytes. After cyclophosphamide, the CD4:CD8 ratio of pancreatic lymphocytes increased to 2.30 $\pm$ 0.24 at day 7. T lymphocytes bearing IL-2 receptors increased two- to three-fold in number and their secretion of GM-CSF/IL-3 and IFN-$\gamma$ increased to a maximum on day 7. Pancreatic insulin content and mRNA levels declined sharply between days 10 and 12, at which time the majority of pancreatic T lymphocytes in hyperglycaemic mice were CD8+ (CD4:CD8 ratio 0.63 $\pm$ 0.04 compared to 4.14 $\pm$ 1.05 in peripheral blood). The pancreatic T lymphocyte CD4:CD8 ratio in prediabetic NOD-Lt mice, which have an incidence of spontaneous diabetes of about 60% at 150 days, was similar to that in untreated NOD-Wehi mice, but 25% of their pancreatic CD8 T lymphocytes were IL-2-receptor positive. Thus, significant changes in the phenotype of NOD pancreatic T lymphocytes following cyclophosphamide were not reflected in peripheral blood or spleen T lymphocytes. The earliest change after cyclophosphamide was an increase in activated, predominantly CD4+ T lymphocytes; with the development of beta cell destruction and hyperglycaemia, pancreatic T lymphocytes were, as in human IDDM, predominantly CD8+.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic $\beta$ cells in the islets of Langerhans. Although defects in various T cell subsets have been linked to the disease pathogenesis, mechanisms initiating or enhancing the autoimmunity in prediabetes remain poorly understood. To unravel genes and molecular pathways affected by the diabetes-associated autoimmunity, we investigated transcriptomic profiles of prospective whole-blood samples from children who have developed T1D-associated autoantibodies and eventually clinical T1D. Gene-level investigation of the data showed systematic differential expression of 520 probesets. A network-based analysis revealed then a highly significant down-regulated network of genes involved in antigen presentation as well as T-cell receptor and insulin signaling. Finally, detection of dynamic changes in the affected pathways at the early or late phases of autoimmunity showed down-regulation of several novel T1D-associated pathways as well as known key components of immune response. The longitudinal genome-wide data generated in the present study allows the detection of dynamic changes relevant to the disease that may be completely missed in conventional cross-sectional studies or in genome-wide association studies. Taken together, our analysis showed systemic high-level repression of immune response pathways associated with T1D autoimmunity.},

abstract = {Islet allografts are subject to alloimmune and autoimmune destruction when transplanted into autoimmune prone animals or humans. The ICOS-B7h pathway plays a role in alloimmune responses, but its function in autoimmunity against islet cells is controversial. We investigated the role of ICOS signaling in autoimmune and alloimmune responses in NOD mice. ICOS blockade prevents development of spontaneous disease in pre-diabetic NOD mice. Furthermore, while ICOS blockade prolongs graft survival in a fully mismatched non-autoimmune islet allograft model in C57BL/6 recipients, it has no beneficial effect in reversing diabetes in models of islet transplantation in NOD mice involving autoimmunity alone or both allo- and autoimmunity. Interestingly, ICOS blockade is effective in prolonging heart allograft (not subject to tissue-specific autoimmunity) survival in NOD mice. We conclude that in islet transplantation and autoimmune diabetes, ICOS blockade can be effective in inhibiting alloimmunity and preventing autoimmunity but is ineffective in inhibiting recurrence of autoimmunity.},

abstract = {Summary Enzyme activity in the livers of mice was studied in examining the metabolic disturbances of diabetes. Spontaneously non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, mice with alloxan-induced diabetes (Allo), and control ICR mice were used. As NOD mice undergo a spontaneous pathogenic process over time, younger and older NOD mice were compared (non-diabetic and diabetic) as were control ICR mice. Two liver enzymes became more active with age, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). AST activity increased more in the hyperglycemic mice, i.e., the diabetic NOD and the Allo mice, than in the normoglycemic group, i.e., the ICR and non-diabetic NOD mice. Abnormally high AST activity was seen in the cytosolic fraction of the liver but not in the mitochondrial fraction. The changes in enzyme activity in diabetic mice were independent of any age-associated changes. The higher AST levels in diabetic mice are thought to be consistent with their greater need for gluconeogenic substrate. AST showed a more notably higher increase than did ALT in this study, and lactate dehydrogenase showed no significant changes.},

Because interleukin 12 (IL-12) is a potent inducer of IFN-$\gamma$ production, we sought evidence implicating IL-12 in IDDM development. In the present study, we used a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay to measure IL-12 mRNA expression levels in islets from nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Expression of mRNA encoding the p40 chain of IL-12 (IL-12 p40) in mono-nuclear leukocytes isolated from islets of female NOD mice increased progressively from age 5 weeks to diabetes onset ({\&}gt;13 weeks). By contrast, IL-12 p40 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in islet mononuclear leukocytes, but not spleens, from female NOD mice protected from diabetes by administration of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in early life. In addition, mRNA levels of IL-12 p40, IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-2 were significantly decreased in syngeneic islet grafts, but not spleens, from female NOD mice protected from diabetes recurrence by CFA administration at the time of islet transplantation. These findings show that IL-12 gene expression in the insulitis lesion correlates with both primary and recurrent diabetes development in NOD mice, possibly via induction of T helper (Th) 1-type cytokines, IL-2 and IFN-$\gamma$.},

T cells from three at-risk subjects demonstrated significant avidity increases (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05 by F test) over time. This avidity shift correlated with the outgrowth of T cells expressing TCR BV 9, 15, 17 or 20 that demonstrated higher GAD 555 tetramer-binding levels compared to cells expressing other TCR BV genes. Similar analysis of autoantibody-negative, first-degree relatives and T1D patients did not demonstrate similar changes in avidity. These data implicate the outgrowth of T cells expressing higher affinity TCR in a process of antigen-specific T cell avidity maturation during the pre-clinical stage of T1D.},

abstract = {Rearrangement analysis of immunoglobulin genes is an exceptional opportunity to look back at the B lymphocyte differentiation during ontogeny and the subsequent immune response, and thus to study the selective pressures involved in autoimmune disorders. In a recent study to characterize the antigenic specificity of B lymphocytes during T1D progression, we generated hybridomas of islet-infiltrating B lymphocytes from NOD mice and other related strains developing insulitis, but with different degrees of susceptibility to T1D. We found that a sizable proportion of hybridomas produced monoclonal antibodies reactive to peripherin, an intermediate filament protein mainly found in the peripheral nervous system. Moreover, we found that anti-peripherin antibody-producing hybridomas originated from B lymphocytes that had undergone immunoglobulin class switch recombination, a characteristic of secondary immune response. Therefore, in the present study we performed immunoglobulin VL and VH analysis of these hybridomas to ascertain whether they were derived from B lymphocytes that had undergone antigen-driven selection. The results indicated that whereas some anti-peripherin hybridomas showed signs of oligoclonality, somatic hypermutation and/or secondary rearrangements (receptor edition and receptor revision), others seemed to directly derive from the preimmune repertoire. In view of these results, we conclude that anti-peripherin B lymphocytes are positively selected and primed in the course of T1D development in NOD mice, and reinforce the idea that peripherin is a relevant autoantigen targeted during T1D development in this animal model.},

Freshly isolated pancreatic $\beta$ cells from ob/ob mice did not express ICAM-1, but treatment of the cells with IL-1-$\beta$, TNF-$\alpha$, or INF-$\gamma$ strongly induced its expression as measured by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. The cytokines acted in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Maximal induction by either cytokine occurred at 24 hr and thereafter expression decreased, except for INF-$\gamma$. Immunoprecipitation from IL-1-$\beta$-treated $\beta$ cells demonstrated a cell-surface glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 95 kDa. ICAM-1 expression was undetectable on pancreatic $\beta$ cells of normal and ob/ob mice as measured by immunohistochemistry. In NOD mice at different ages (1 to 6 months) ICAM-1 was also undetectable on $\beta$ cells, in contrast to the strong expression on infiltrating mononuclear cells. The present study indicates that mouse pancreatic $\beta$ cells, under certain conditions, can express ICAM-1.},

Ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including two promoter SNPs in the IL4R locus on chromosome 16p11, one promoter SNP in the IL4 locus on chromosome 5q31, and four SNPs---including two promoter SNPs---in the IL13 locus on chromosome 5q31 were examined for association, linkage disequilibrium, and interaction. We found that both individual SNPs (IL4R L389L; odds ratio [OR] 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17--0.67; P=.001) and specific haplotypes both in IL4R (OR 0.10; 95% CI 0--0.5; P=.001) and for the five linked IL4 and IL13 SNPs (OR 3.47; P=.004) were strongly associated with susceptibility to T1D. Since IL4 and IL13 both serve as ligands for a receptor composed, in part, of the IL4R $\alpha$ chain, we looked for potential epistasis between polymorphisms in the IL4R locus on chromosome 16p11 and the five SNPs in the IL4 and IL13 loci on chromosome 5q31 and found, through use of a logistic-regression model, significant gene-gene interactions (P=.045, corrected for multiple comparisons by permutation analysis). Our data suggest that the risk for T1D is determined, in part, by polymorphisms within the IL4R locus, including promoter and coding-sequence variants, and by specific combinations of genotypes at the IL4R and the IL4 and IL13 loci.},

abstract = {Aim To assess the association of POMC haplotype-tagged single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) with the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in a Caucasian population. Methods All exons, intron 1, and approximately 6-kb upstream and 3-kb downstream of the POMC gene were bidirectionally resequenced to identify DNA polymorphisms in 30 individuals. Allele frequencies were determined (60 chromosomes) and efficient htSNPs were selected using the htSNP2 programme. Genotyping was performed in 390 cases, 339 controls and 245 T1D parent-offspring trios, using Taqman, Sequenom and direct-sequencing technologies. Results Thirteen polymorphisms (two novel) with a minor allele frequency greater than 1% were identified. Six POMC htSNPs (rs3754863 G{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}gt;{\&}{\#}xa0;A, ss161151662 A{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}gt;{\&}{\#}xa0;G, rs3754860 C{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}gt;{\&}{\#}xa0;T, rs1009388 G{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}gt;{\&}{\#}xa0;C, rs3769671 A{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}gt;{\&}{\#}xa0;C, rs1042571 G{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}gt;{\&}{\#}xa0;A) were identified. Allele and haplotype frequencies were similar between case and control groups (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}gt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.60 by permutation test), and assessment of allele transmission distortion from informative parents to affected offspring also failed to find any association. Stratification of these analyses for age-at-onset and HLA-DR risk group (DR3/DR4) revealed no significant associations. A haplotype block of 9.86-kb from rs3754863 to rs1042571 was identified, encompassing the POMC gene. Comparison of haplotype frequencies identified the GGCGAG haplotype as protective against T1D in 12.9% of cases vs. 18.3% of controls: $\chi$2{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;8.18, Pc{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.03 by permutation test. Conclusion The POMC SNP haplotype GGCGAG may have a protective effect against T1D in the UK population. However, this finding needs to be replicated, and the cellular and molecular processes influenced by this POMC haplotype determined to fully appreciate its impact.},

abstract = {Summary Immune responses can be enhanced or dampened by differential manipulation of Foxp3-expressing CD25+CD4+ natural regulatory T (Treg) cells versus other naive or activated T cells. By searching for a molecule capable of distinguishing these populations, we here found that natural Treg cells constitutively expressed high amounts of folate receptor 4 (FR4). The expression of FR4 and CD25 also separated antigen-stimulated CD4+ non-Treg cells into the FR4hiCD25− and FR4loCD25+ populations, which were different in proliferation and cytokine secretion upon restimulation. These distinctions showed that antigenic stimulation activated and expanded antigen-specific natural Treg cells as well as effector and memory T cells. Accordingly, FR4hiCD25+CD4+ T cells enriched from alloantigen-stimulated T cells suppressed graft rejection. Administration of FR4 monoclonal antibody specifically reduced Treg cells, provoking effective tumor immunity in tumor-bearing animals, whereas similar treatment of normal young mice elicited autoimmune disease. Thus, specific manipulation of FR4hiCD25+CD4+ Treg cells helps control ongoing immune responses.},

To rule out the possibility that the I-E expression merely delays the onset of insulitis, we have further characterized the expression and function of the I-E molecule expressed in transgenic NOD mice and confirmed our previous observations. Northern blot analysis showed that the transgenic E$\alpha$d gene was expressed in a pattern similar to the endogenous E$\alpha$d gene in BALB/c mice. The newly expressed I-E molecules were recognized as an alloantigen by the T lymphocytes of normal NOD mice as shown by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Transgenic NOD mice were resistant to the treatment by cyclophosphamide, which effectively induces diabetes in normal NOD mice, and did not develop diabetes up to 40 weeks of age. On the basis of these findings, we discuss the role of I-E molecules in the prevention of diabetes in NOD mice.},

abstract = {Stiff person syndrome is a rare CNS disorder characterized by progressive muscular rigidity (trunk muscles), with superimposed spasms. High titres of antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Ab) are present in more than 70 % of patients. Adult-onset cerebellar ataxia (CA) is the second most frequent disease associated with high titers of GAD-Ab, and characterized by an almost isolated cerebellar syndrome. Both syndromes are frequently associated with autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D). The immunogenetic basis of SPS is supported by the DQB1*0201 allele, a susceptibility allele for T1D. Several T1D autoantigens are related to proteins of the nervous system. The concordance of both neurological diseases with T1D and the presence of anti-GAD antibodies suggest a common aetiology.

abstract = {Rodents have two functional preproinsulin genes named insulin 1 and insulin 2 on different chromosome and have two amino acid differences in insulin B chain. We have established insulin 1 or insulin 2 knockout (KO) non-obese diabetic (NOD) colonies in the animal institute of Kobe University and evaluated anti-insulin autoimmunity. Similar to the previous report, insulin 1-KO provides strong protection from insulitis (islet-infiltration of mononuclear cells) and diabetes, whereas the insulin 2-KO markedly accelerated insulitis and development of diabetes even at further backcross breeding with NOD/Shi/Kbe mice (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.0001). Expression of serum anti-insulin autoantibodies (IAA) was enhanced in insulin 2-KO mice at a time between 10 and 15 weeks of age (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.005) while the expression of insulin 1-KO NOD mice was rather reduced. Furthermore, T cell reactivity in splenocytes of insulin 2-KO NOD mice to insulin 1 B:9-23 peptide was increased (P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05), suggesting that expanding insulin-reactive T cells may contribute to the acceleration of diabetes in insulin 2-KO mice. Based on those observations, we hypothesize that insulin 1 is a crucial T cell antigen in murine autoimmune diabetes and modification of anti-insulin autoimmunity can be applicable to antigen-based therapy for human type 1 diabetic patients.},

Transgenic expression of HLA-DR3 and -DQ8 (either alone or in combination) did not confer susceptibility to spontaneous or cyclophosphamide-induced type 1 diabetes. Expression of I-Ag7 was mandatory for development of spontaneous or cyclophosphamide-induced diabetes. However, multiple low doses of streptozotocin could induce diabetes in all groups of mice independent of the class II molecules expressed. In unmanipulated mice, only islets from I-Ag7+/+ mice revealed significant intra-islet infiltration. Although a characteristic peri-insulitis/peri-ductulitis was present in A$\beta$0/NOD mice, islets from DR3, DQ8 and DR3.DQ8 double transgenic mice demonstrated significantly less infiltration. In conclusion, transgenic expression of HLA-DR3 and -DQ8 associated with predisposition to type 1 diabetes alone is not sufficient to induce spontaneous diabetes in NOD mice lacking endogenous class II molecules.},

We studied the effects of LDV infection on the development of diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Five-week-old female NOD mice were infected with LDV (108 ID50/mouse) and observed until 23 weeks of age. None of the 21-LDV-infected mice developed diabetes, whereas 1014 (71.4%) uninfected mice did. Although the subpopulations of T cells and the percentage of Mac1-positive cells in the NOD murine spleen and the number of harvested peritoneal macrophages were unaffected by LDV infection, the proportions of Ia-positive peritoneal macrophages were significantly decreased in LDV-infected compared with uninfected mice (1.1 $\pm$ 0.2%, 6.5 $\pm$ 2.9%; P {\&}lt; 0.01). In LDV-infected NOD mice, insulitis of the same grade as that seen in uninfected NOD mice was observed. In another experiment, 3, 5, 10 or 16-week-old female NOD mice were infected with LDV. None of the mice infected with LDV at 3, 5 or 10 weeks of age developed diabetes and only one of six infected at 16 weeks of age did. These findings indicate that LDV infection suppresses the development of diabetes in female NOD mice by reducing the capacity of Ia-positive macrophages, and suggest that the development of human type 1 diabetes may be suppressed by certain viral infections.},

Consecutively received laboratory samples were evaluated using the Ultegra Rapid Platelet Function Assay-ASA. Resistance to aspirin was detected in 18.7% of diabetic aspirin users, with similar rates in T1D (21.7%, p = 0.5) and T2D (16.2%, p = 0.6). Aspirin resistance was not related to age, glycohemoglobin, total cholesterol, or a history of cardiovascular disease. Female gender was a strong independent predictor of aspirin resistance in patients with T1D (p = 0.001). Platelet aggregation was correlated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in the entire cohort (r = 0.21, p = 0.005) and in patients with T1D (r = 0.32, p = 0.04) or T2D (r = 0.21, p = 0.04), such that patients with low HDL cholesterol levels were more likely to be aspirin sensitive. The results suggest that aspirin can inhibit platelet aggregation in most patients with diabetes and is a reasonable first-line antiplatelet agent in patients with diabetes.},

abstract = {Abstract Human genome wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified at least four new, non-MHC-linked candidate genes or gene regions causing type one diabetes (T1D), highlighting the need for functional models to investigate how susceptibility alleles at multiple common genes interact to mediate disease. Progress in localizing genes in congenic strains of the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse has allowed the reproducible testing of gene functions and gene--gene interactions that can be reflected biologically as intrapathway interactions, for example, IL-2 and its receptor CD25, pathway-pathway interactions such as two signaling pathways within a cell, or cell-cell interactions. Recent studies have identified likely causal genes in two congenic intervals associated with T1D, Idd3, and Idd5, and have documented the occurrence of gene--gene interactions, including ``genetic masking'', involving the genes encoding the critical immune molecules IL-2 and CTLA-4. The demonstration of gene--gene interactions in congenic mouse models of T1D has major implications for the understanding of human T1D since such biological interactions are highly likely to exist for human T1D genes. Although it is difficult to detect most gene--gene interactions in a population in which susceptibility and protective alleles at many loci are randomly segregating, their existence as revealed in congenic mice reinforces the hypothesis that T1D alleles can have strong biological effects and that such genes highlight pathways to consider as targets for immune intervention.},

Cytokines released from islet-infiltrating mononuclear cells are known to be cytotoxic both directly and by upregulating Fas for FasL-induced apoptosis. To investigate the role of caspase-3, a major effector of apoptosis in $\beta$-cell death, we asked whether cytokine- and/or FasL-induced apoptosis was associated with increased activity of caspase-3 in NIT-1 insulinoma cells and islets of autoimmune diabetes-prone NOD mice. Measurement of caspase-3 activity using a fluorogenic cleavage assay was validated in NOD mouse thymocytes undergoing dexamethasone (Dex)-induced apoptosis. For cytokine-induced apoptosis, NIT-1 cells or islets were exposed to IL-1$\beta$ and IFN-$\gamma$ for 24{\&}{\#}xa0;h. Caspase-3-like activity was increased 2.1{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;0.7 and 2.4{\&}{\#}xa0;$\pm${\&}{\#}xa0;0.9-fold in lysates of cytokine-treated NIT-1 cells and NOD mouse islets, respectively. However, NIT-1 cells exhibited 2.1% (4.7{\&}{\#}xa0;pg active caspase-3/$\mu$g protein) and islets 0.8% (1.9{\&}{\#}xa0;pg active caspase-3/$\mu$g protein) of the active caspase-3 content observed in Dex-treated thymocytes (225.1{\&}{\#}xa0;pg active caspase-3/$\mu$g protein).

Addition of FasL for a further 3{\&}{\#}xa0;h increased caspase-3-like activity an additional 1.8-fold in cytokine-treated NIT-1 cells. In summary, exposure of NOD mouse insulinoma cells or islets to IL-1$\beta$ and IFN-$\gamma$ for 24{\&}{\#}xa0;h induced caspase-3-like activity that, in the case of insulinoma cells at least, can be further enhanced by interaction of cytokine-induced Fas receptor with FasL.

abstract = {We have previously shown that diabetes in the NOD mouse can be prevented if mice are placed from weaning on an infant formula diet in which the protein source is replaced with casein hydrolysate (Pregestimil) or soy protein (Prosobee), or if 1% nicotinamide is given in the drinking water. Nicotinamide somewhat suppresses insulitis but the hydrolysed casein formula does not. In this study, Prosobee was given concurrently with oral nicotinamide from weaning and their effects on the development of insulitis and diabetes measured. These effects were also assessed in mice given Prosobee alone from conception (day −20) or from weaning. Unlike the earlier experiments, a marked suppression of insulitis was observed when the diets and nicotinamide were given concurrently (mean insulitis scores +95% confidence intervals (back transformed): day 40 = 0.4% [0.03, 1.17] vs. 12.5% [2.52, 28.40] and at day 90 = 8.8% [3.65, 15.68] vs. 48.1% [33.89, 62.49], P = 0.0001). A similar suppression was observed on day 90 with Pregestimil combined with nicotinamide 7.3% [3.88, 11.70] vs. 43.8% [32.59, 55.35] (P = 0.0001). Qualitatively, introduction of Prosobee from conception appeared to elicit a greater degree of suppression of insulitis than when introduced from day 21. Insulitis lesions were examined immunohistochemically for CD4, CD8 and MAC-1 cells. The proportion of these cells was not different for any regime despite the great differences in total number of inflammatory cells in and around the islets of mice fed the combined diet. All the three dietary treatments (Prosobee from day −20, Prosobee from day 21, Prosobee + nicotinamide from day 21) resulted in substantial protection from diabetes in mice followed until 250 days. We conclude that the complete prevention of diabetes in the NOD mouse fed a casein-free diet together with nicotinamide is accompanied by marked inhibition of insulitis, which is not seen when either dietary agent is introduced alone. The somewhat greater suppression of insulitis in mice given the soy diet from conception compared to those fed from day 21 may indicate that even maternal diet during gestation may influence diabetes outcome in the offspring.},

abstract = {To elucidate the insulin action in skeletal muscles in insulin-dependent diabetes, the glucose uptake by isolated soleus muscles was studied in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic mice and nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice that develop insulinopenic diabetes spontaneously. The maximally insulin-stimulated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose was significantly decreased in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice with 3 to 6 weeks duration of diabetes (10.18 $\pm$ 0.58 v 12.80 $\pm$ 0.44 nmol/muscle/20 min, P {\&}lt; .005), while basal 2-deoxyglucose uptake was not significantly altered in them. The net insulin-stimulated uptake measured individually was also significantly reduced in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice (1.33 $\pm$ 0.23 v 4.07 $\pm$ 0.40 nmol/muscle/20 min, P {\&}lt; .001). This was the case with STZ-diabetic ICR mice with 6 weeks duration of diabetes and STZ-diabetic NOD mice with 2 weeks and 6 weeks durations of diabetes as well. The submaximal effect of insulin on 2-deoxyglucose uptake by the soleus muscle, defined as the percent of the maximal effect achieved at 10 ng/mL of insulin, was not significantly altered in STZ-diabetic NOD mice. These data suggest that a prolonged insulinopenic state might reduce the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscles by diminishing the insulin responsiveness and cause the insulin resistance in diabetic animals.},

The main risk factors for the development of GVHD are the degree of HLA disparity between donor and recipient and the precursor frequency and intensity of T cell responses against major or minor histocompatibility antigens. However, allogeneic T cell responses do not occur in a static and sterile environment, but are modulated by the inflammatory milieu in lymphoid and GVHD target tissues that influences the functional characteristics of antigen presenting cells APCs. Here, we summarize our recent findings concerning the pro- and anti-inflammatory function of (APCs) in the gastrointestinal tract, the role of APCs in the induction of GVH and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) responses, and their influence on suppressive effects mediated by regulatory T cells.},

Obtaining the large number of antigen-sensitive monospecific T cells required for conventional antigen discovery methods has historically been problematic due to (1) difficulties in culturing autoreactive CD8+ T cells from NOD mice and (2) the large time and resource investments required for the generation of transgenic NOD mice. We circumvented these problems by exploiting the rapid generation time of retrogenic (Rg) mice, relative to transgenic mice, as a novel source of sensitive monospecific CD8+ T cells, using the diabetogenic AI4 T cell receptor on NOD.SCID and NOD.Rag1−/− backgrounds as a model. Rg AI4 T cells are diabetogenic in vivo, demonstrating for the first time that Rg mice are a means for assessing the pathogenic potential of CD8+ T cell receptor specificities. In order to obtain a sufficient number of Rg CD8+ T cells for antigen screens, we optimized a method for their in vitro culture that resulted in a ∼{\&}{\#}xa0;500 fold expansion. We demonstrate the high sensitivity and specificity of expanded Rg AI4 T cells in the contexts of (1) specific peptide challenge, (2) islet cytotoxicity, and (3) their ability to resolve previously defined mimotope candidates from a positional scanning peptide library. Our method is the first to combine the speed of Rg technology with an optimized in vitro Rg T cell expansion protocol to enable the rapid discovery of T cell antigens.},

abstract = {Dendritic cells (DC) are key components of the immune system, which actively participate in innate and adaptive immune responses. They are traditionally viewed as the immunologic centerpiece that is able to prime CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell effector populations. However, accumulated evidence highlights the functional plasticity of DC, which are shown to also be able to display a tolerogenic function eliciting the differentiation of T suppressor (Ts) and regulatory (Treg) cells. This tolerogenic state of DC is characterized by low costimulatory potential and high expression of inhibitory receptors. Conspicuously among the latter is the immunoglobulin-like transcript 3 (ILT3), which independently prevents the activation of both DC and T cells. DC overexpressing ILT3 display lower phosphorylation levels of NF-$\kappa$B and fail to stimulate the full program of Th proliferation and maturation eliciting instead the differentiation of CD8+ TS and CD4+ Treg. In contrast, ILT3-knockdown DC have robust cytokine and chemokine production, and are able to trigger stronger T-cell responses to viral antigens or alloantigens. Understanding and manipulating the functional immunogenic/tolerogenic dichotomy of DC has important clinical applications for achieving tolerance in organ transplantation, stemming autoimmune diseases or, conversely, generating efficient immunogenic vaccines for immunotherapy in cancer and chronic viral diseases.},

We show that progression to autoimmune diabetes results in the conversion of naive low-avidity autoreactive CD8+ T cells into memory-like autoregulatory cells that can be expanded in vivo with nanoparticles coated with disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC-NP). Treatment of NOD mice with monospecific pMHC-NPs expanded cognate autoregulatory T cells, suppressed the recruitment of noncognate specificities, prevented disease in prediabetic mice, and restored normoglycemia in diabetic animals. pMHC-NP therapy was inconsequential in mice engineered to bear an immune system unresponsive to the corresponding epitope, owing to absence of epitope-experienced autoregulatory T cells. pMHC-NP-expanded autoregulatory T cells suppressed local presentation of autoantigens in an interferon-$\gamma$-, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-, and perforin-dependent manner. Nanoparticles coated with human diabetes-relevant pHLA complexes restored normoglycemia in a humanized model of diabetes. These observations expose a paradigm in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity amenable for therapeutic intervention.},

Pregnant NOD mouse macrophages showed no basal NF$\kappa$B activation, lower IL-12 and nitrites production compared with the macrophages from non-pregnant NOD mice. Their pro-inflammatory aberrant response to LPS and apoptotic cell challenge was reduced and VIP inhibited macrophage residual deleterious responses to apoptotic cells.

The optimal preclinical testing of promising therapies would be aided by a humanized immune-mediated T1D model. We develop this model in NOD-scid IL2r$\gamma$null mice. The selective destruction of pancreatic islet $\beta$ cells was mediated by human T lymphocytes after an initial trigger was supplied by the injection of irradiated spleen mononuclear cells (SMC) from diabetic nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. This resulted in severe insulitis, a marked loss of total $\beta$-cell mass, and other related phenotypes of T1D. The migration of human T cells to pancreatic islets was controlled by the $\beta$ cell-produced highly conserved chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and its receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR) 4, as demonstrated by in vivo blocking experiments using antibody to CXCR4. The specificity of humanized T cell-mediated immune responses against islet $\beta$ cells was generated by the local inflammatory microenvironment in pancreatic islets including human CD4+ T cell infiltration and clonal expansion, and the mouse islet $\beta$-cell-derived CD1d-mediated human iNKT activation. The selective destruction of mouse islet $\beta$ cells by a human T cell-mediated immune response in this humanized T1D model can mimic those observed in T1D patients. This model can provide a valuable tool for translational research into T1D.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes in the NOD mouse is under polygenic control, with a major susceptibility gene, Idd1, in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). To investigate the contribution of the NOD MHC to type 1 diabetes susceptibility, a B6.NOD-H-2 congenic strain, in which the NOD MHC was introgressed onto the genetic background of the C57BL/6 strain, was established. Despite possession of the diabetogenic MHC from the NOD mouse, none of the B6.NOD-H-2 mice developed type 1 diabetes, indicating that the NOD MHC alone is not sufficient for type 1 diabetes and that non-MHC genes are also necessary. One of the strongest non-MHC genes is Idd3, and Il2 which encodes interleukin 2, is a candidate gene for Idd3. To test whether a combination of the NOD MHC with the NOD allele of Il2 is sufficient for type 1 diabetes, B6.NOD-H-2 mice were crossed with C3H mice, which possess the NOD allele at Il2, and F2 mice homozygous for NOD alleles at both the MHC and Il2 were produced. None of the F2 mice developed type 1 diabetes, suggesting that NOD alleles at MHC (Idd1) and Il2 (Idd3) are not sufficient for type 1 diabetes in the NOD mouse.},

abstract = {It is thought that viral infections might jeopardize regulatory T cell therapy in type 1 diabetes. Viral infections can lead to surface expression of ligands for the activating NKG2D receptor, such as retinoic acid early transcript 1 (Rae-1), whose expression on beta-cells recruits NKG2D+ autoreactive CD8+ T cells. Both in men and mice, autoreactive cytotoxic T cells express NKG2D. We showed that NKG2D expression increased on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during virus-induced diabetes development in the rat insulin promotor (RIP) Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) model. Combination treatment with anti-NKG2D and antigen-specific regulatory T cells (Treg), at doses inefficacious in mono-treatment, synergized to prevent diabetes in 75% of the virus-infected RIP-LCMV mice. Nevertheless, NKG2D blockade alone failed to reverse recent-onset diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, despite downregulation of NKG2D on NK cells in the blood and CD8+ T cells in the spleen and pancreatic lymph nodes. Our data suggest that blocking the interaction of NKG2D with it ligands is insufficient to protect against diabetes when a strong inflammatory process actively drives NKG2D upregulation, but should be considered to help maintaining Treg functionality during ongoing pancreatic inflammation.},

In this study we investigated the association between four VDR polymorphisms and susceptibility to T1D in Crete, an island with homogenous population and considerably low incidence of T1D. Results and discussion We genotyped 100 patients with T1D and 96 controls for the FokI (rs10735810), BsmI (rs1544410), ApaI (rs7975232), and TaqI (rs731236) single nucleotide polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. In all 4 polymorphisms tested, distribution of VDR genotype frequencies differed significantly between patients and controls. Individuals with T1D presented less commonly with FokI F allele (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.008; OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.85) and BsmI B allele (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.042; OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.97) and more commonly with ApaI A allele (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.024; OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.41) and TaqI T allele (p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.0001; OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.36). Conclusion Our findings derived from a homogenous southern European population with low incidence of T1D suggest that FokI, BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI polymorphisms of the VDR gene are associated with T1D prevalence.},

Lymphocytes from NOD mice showed significantly less suppressor ability than did those from BALBc mice and non-obese non-diabetic (NON) mice, the corresponding non-diabetic sister strain of the NOD mouse, both in the mitogen response and in the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). We used monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry to analyze the lymphocytic surface phenotypes, and found markedly fewer Lyt2+ T-lymphocytes (suppressor/cytotoxic T-lymphocyte) in the NOD mice than in both controls after exposure to ConA. These results suggest that suppressor T-cell activity is already depressed in NOD mice before diabetes begins and that a substantial decrease in the number of suppressor T-cells induced by ConA may explain this depressed suppressor activity. This impairment may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice.},

MMPs also regulate the function of leukocytes via proteolytic processing of cytokines/chemokines. In this study, we measured the production of MMP-9 and its natural tissue inhibitor (TIMP)-1 by leukocytes isolated from human type I diabetic patients. MMP-9 was also detected in serum and splenocytes from non-obese diabetic (NOD) and BALB/c mice. MMP-9 was markedly elevated in leukocytes from diabetics compared to non-diabetic controls. TIMP-1 production was also enhanced in leukocytes from diabetics, but substantially less than MMP-9, with the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio being 1.6-fold higher in neutrophils and 3-fold higher in monocytes than controls. Interleukin (IL)-2 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment increased MMP-9 production in leukocytes from both diabetics and normal controls, whereas insulin decreased MMP-9 expression. Recombinant MMP-9 stimulated the proliferation of mouse splenocytes from NOD or BALB/c and a MMP-9 inhibitor dose-dependently inhibited splenocyte proliferation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate firstly that MMP-9 expression is elevated in leukocytes from type I diabetic patients and NOD mice and secondly, that MMP-9 elevates proliferation of mouse splenocytes. These data suggest that elevated leukocyte MMP-9 may contribute to the pathogenesis of type I diabetes and its associated complications.},

In spite of extensive genetic and immunological studies, mainly performed in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) spontaneous mouse model, the etiology of the autoimmune attack remains unknown. Several autoantigens have been identified and numerous studies have suggested a role for defective regulation of immune function. However, this account does not explain why the autoimmune process specifically affects the insulin-producing $\beta$ cells. Thus, abnormal immune regulation might explain the predisposition to autoimmunity in general, but additional factors should then determine the target of the autoimmune attack. Here, we review the evidence that abnormalities in islet cell differentiation and function exist that might trigger the immune system towards $\beta$-cell autoimmunity in humans and NOD mice.},

abstract = {The pathology of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) involves the autoimmune destruction or malfunction of pancreatic $\beta$ cells, leading to a lack of insulin. The absence of insulin is life-threatening, necessitating daily hormone injections from an exogenous source. Insulin injections do not adequately mimic the precise regulation of $\beta$ cells on glucose homeostasis, however, eventually leading to complications in diabetic patients. There currently is no definitive cure for T1D. Pancreas transplantation, although quite successful, is an invasive intervention that is restricted to patients with advanced complications, requires constant immunosuppression, and is severely limited by donor availability. Recent progress in human islet cell isolation and immunosuppressive protocols has restored euglycemia in patients who received islet cells from 2 or 3 pancreas donors. However, because of the scarcity of cadaver pancreata and the low yield of islet cells obtained by the procedure, not all patients have access to this surgical intervention. Thus, other therapeutic approaches are needed to arrest immune aggression, preserve $\beta$ cell mass, and provide efficient replacement. In this sense, bone marrow and umbilical cord blood transplantation are promising possibilities that merit exploration. In this review, we summarize multiple strategies that have been proposed and tested for potential therapeutic benefit in patients with T1D.},

We analyzed the response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy blood donors to human islet-cell preparations with a composition similar to that of islet grafts used in clinical transplantation trials. It was examined whether the degree of major histocompatibility complex incompatibility between PBMC and donor islet cells is related to the degree of proliferative T-cell responses during coculture of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched and mismatched PBMC with human islet cell-preparations (i.e., mixed islet/lymphocyte reaction). Prominent T-cell responses were observed in the vast majority of cases of double HLA class II mismatches. Intermediate T-cell responsiveness was observed in single HLA class II mismatches, whereas HLA matches did not induce a T-cell response.

Candidate gene and, more recently, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have led to an explosion in the number of loci and pathways known to contribute to autoimmune phenotypes. Since the 1970s, researchers have known that several alleles in the MHC region play a role in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. More recent work has identified numerous risk loci involving both the innate and adaptive immune responses. However, much remains to be learned about the heritability of autoimmune conditions. Most regions found through GWA scans have yet to isolate the association to the causal allele(s) responsible for conferring disease risk. A role for rare variants (allele frequencies of {\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;1%) has begun to emerge. Future research will use next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to comprehensively evaluate the human genome for risk variants. Whole-transcriptome sequencing is now possible, which will provide much more detailed gene expression data. The dramatic drop in the cost and time required to sequence the entire human genome will ultimately make it possible for this technology to be used as a clinical diagnostic tool.},

Methods Children with T1D (n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;45) and their non-diabetic siblings (n{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;28) participated in the study. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRPhs) were measured between 1400 and 1800{\&}{\#}xa0;h. Glucocorticoid metabolites were measured in the first morning urine on clinic day and 11$\beta$-HSD1 activity was estimated by tetrahydrocortisol/tetrahydrocortisone (THF/THE) ratio. Results Diabetic patients presented with an increased THF/THE ratio compared with controls (median: 0.68 [range: 0.45--1.18] vs 0.45 [0.27--0.98], respectively; P{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;10--3). There was no difference between diabetic patients and controls for IL-6 (0.6{\&}{\#}xa0;ng/mL [0.6--6.8] vs 0.6 [0.6--2.2], respectively; P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.43) and CRPhs (0.4{\&}{\#}xa0;mg/L [0--7.4] vs 0.3 [0--8.2]; P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.26, respectively).

Conclusion Low-grade inflammation assessed by plasma CRPhs and IL-6 concentrations was not detectable in our cohort of T1D children. Nocturnal 11$\beta$-HSD1 activity was increased and associated with plasma CRPhs concentration in diabetic patients. These results may be explained by either a direct or inflammation-mediated effect of the relative hepatic lack of insulin due to subcutaneous insulin therapy.},

abstract = {Acute exacerbations (AEs) of chronic hepatitis B (CH-B) are thought to be the result of breakdown of immune tolerance on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Immune tolerance to HBV maintained in CH-B patients without hepatitis is under the control of the host's forkhead box p3-expressing regulatory T cells (Tregs). Its breakdown mimics the occurrence of autoimmune diseases. Severe AEs may lead to liver decompensation and mortalities. Consequently, AEs are currently the major therapeutic targets in patient treatment. In this study, we employed the SYFPEITHI scoring system to identify epitopes on HBV core antigen (HBcAg) for the construction of human leukocyte antigen class II tetramers to measure HBcAg-specific Treg frequencies (Tregf). Upregulation of Treg gene profiling accompanied by increased HBcAg-specific Tregf was detected in AE patients with sustained remission (SR) to anti-HBV therapy. Depletion of Tregs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells enhanced proliferation to HBcAg. HBcAg-specific Treg clones inhibited the killing capacity of cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones in an antigen-independent manner. A greater posttherapy increase in HBcAg-specific Tregf correlated with a higher SR rate to anti-HBV therapy. These results suggest that HBcAg-specific Tregs function as suppressor effectors and confer SR to anti-HBV therapy.},

abstract = {Insulin is a predominant autoantigen in IDDM in man and the NOD mouse. Failure of negative selection of diabetogenic T cells in thymus may be an important pre-disposing cause of the disease. To obtain insight into negative selection against such T-cell clones the thymic expression of insulin was studied in NOD and Balb/c mice by quantitative competitive RT-PCR. We detected RNA for insulin in the thymus of 3-week-old Balb/c mice as well as in NOD mice. However, the NOD mice expressed only half as many insulin transcripts as the Balb/c mice. Also, insulin protein was detected in the thymic medulla of both Balb/c and NOD mice. Furthermore, thymic RNA preparations were investigated for the presence of insulin transcription factors. None of the known pancreatic transcription factors for insulin; Pdx-1, Pax6 or Nkx6.1 were detectable in the thymus of Balb/c mice. These results support the idea that low insulin expression in the thymus may be a predisposing cause for development of diabetes in NOD mice analogous with what has been found in humans with the disease-disposing IDDM2 allele. Furthermore, our results suggest that insulin expression in the thymus may be regulated by different principles from those in the pancreas.},

In particular, we focus on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling, and how stimuli such as nutrients and leptin activate mTOR in an oscillatory manner to determine Treg cell proliferation status. We propose that metabolic changes such as nutritional deprivation or overload could dictate the characteristics of the Treg cell compartment and subsequent downstream immune reactions.},

Our results showed that G/10-DCs suppressed both insulitis and spontaneous diabetes in NOD and HLA-DQ8/RIP-B7.1 mice. The suppression was likely to be mediated by T cells, as we found that regulatory CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells were significantly increased in G/10-DC treated animals. In vivo, the G/10-DCs inhibited diabetogenic T cell proliferation; in vitro, they had reduced expression of costimulatory molecules and produced little IL-12/23 p40 or IL-6 but a large amount of IL-10 when compared with DCs matured in the presence of IL-4 (G/4-DC). We conclude that IL-10-treated DCs are tolerogenic and induce islet-directed immune tolerance, which was likely to be mediated by T regulatory cells. This non-antigen-specific DC-based approach offers potential for a new therapeutic intervention in T1D.},

We found suggestive evidence for association of the FCRL3 −169CC genotype, corresponding to the susceptibility genotype for rheumatoid arthritis, with an increased risk of additional autoimmunity markers (OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;1.97, P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.01) and of other autoimmune diseases (OR{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;1.75, P{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.05). However, there was no evidence of association of this variant with T1D in these cohorts, separately and combined, nor in subgroups of patients defined based on their major T1D risk factors at HLA-DRB1, insulin and PTPN22. Hence, this variant may help define subgroups of T1D patients with contrasted risk of other autoimmune diseases.},

abstract = {Recently, the anti-CD3 antibody has been shown to be a promising candidate for the efficient treatment of overt autoimmunity. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Our previous studies demonstrated that natural killer (NK)T cells and transforming growth factor (TGF)-$\beta$ were key elements in anti-CD3 F(ab′)2-mediated re-establishment of glucose homeostasis and restoration of self tolerance to islets in type 1 diabetes. In this report, we further investigate the regulatory pathways involved, especially the cellular source of TGF-$\beta$ production. The treatment of new-onset nonobese diabetic mice with anti-CD3 F(ab′)2 resulted in a significant increase in the numbers of NK cells in spleen and pancreatic lymph nodes that secrete TGF-$\beta$. Depletion of this cell population with a specific anti-AsGM1 antibody abrogated anti-CD3 F(ab′)2 therapeutic effects and splenic TGF-$\beta$ production. When fractionated from recovered mice after CD3 antibody therapy, these NK cells actively suppressed diabetogenic cell proliferation and prevented the cotransfer of diabetes into nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient mice in a TGF-$\beta$-dependent manner. In addition, the regulatory NKT cells from remitting mice were capable of causing NK cells to exhibit a TGF-$\beta$-producing phenotype by the secretion of the T helper 2 cytokines interleukins 4 and 10. Overall, these data indicate that NK cells are the main source of TGF-$\beta$ production after anti-CD3 F(ab′)2 treatment, which are controlled by a population of T helper 2-like NKT cells.},

Latent pernicious anemia precedes clinically-manifest pernicious anemia and may be difficult to detect solely on simple analytical grounds. We recently described an increased prevalence of clinically-latent pernicious anemia in T1D using low concentrations of pepsinogen I, a zymogen of pepsin present in gastric mucosa, as a useful additional diagnostic marker, besides parietal cell antibodies, for screening latent pernicious anemia in T1D. The failure of peripheral tolerance mechanisms such as regulatory T cells (Treg) might be involved in CAG development in T1D patients. Indeed, functional defects in Tregs have been described in T1D patients. To this end, the percentage of Tregs in peripheral blood of T1D-CAG patients was analyzed and compared with those of a group of T1D without associated autoantibodies and a healthy control group. Tregs levels were also analyzed in gastric biopsies of T1D-CAG patients. The results obtained have led to new questions regarding the pathogenic mechanisms implicated in the development of associated autoimmune diseases in T1D.},

This pro-inflammatory cytokine cocktail concomitantly induced loss of islet glucose stimulated insulin response (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05), elevated expression of MCP-1 (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.01), increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induced cell death. Inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, apocynin and diphenyleneiodonium, and a dual selective NOX1/4 inhibitor, blocked ROS generation (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.01) and induction of MCP-1 (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05) by pro-inflammatory cytokines in beta cells. It has previously been reported that pro-inflammatory cytokine stimulation induces 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) expression in human islets. 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), a product of 12-LO activity, stimulated NOX-1 expression in human islets (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05).

Inhibition was not seen with a structurally related but inactive analog. Importantly, islets from human type 2 diabetic donors have an elevated expression of NOX-1 (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05).

abstract = {1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), the biologically active form of vitamin D, is widely recognized as a modulator of the immune system as well as a regulator of mineral metabolism. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of vitamin D status and treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 on diabetes onset in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a murine model of human type I diabetes. We have found that vitamin D-deficiency increases the incidence of diabetes in female mice from 46% (n=13) to 88% (n=8) and from 0% (n=10) to 44% (n=9) in male mice as of 200 days of age when compared to vitamin D-sufficient animals. Addition of 50{\&}{\#}xa0;ng of 1,25(OH)2D3/day to the diet prevented disease onset as of 200 days and caused a significant rise in serum calcium levels, regardless of gender or vitamin D status. Our results indicate that vitamin D status is a determining factor of disease susceptibility and oral administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 prevents diabetes onset in NOD mice through 200 days of age.},

abstract = {Objective Because cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and dyslipidemia is an important CVD risk factor, we investigated dyslipidemia and its treatment in children with T1D. Study design Subjects had T1D (n = 360), repeated lipid measurements (n = 1095; mean, 3.04 $\pm$ 0.94; range, 2 to 11), and were seen between 1994 and 2004. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL) were categorized on the basis of published guidelines. Age, diabetes duration, sex, body mass index, HbA1c, and lipid-lowering medication use were recorded. Predictors of TC, HDL, and non-HDL were determined. Results Sustained abnormalities existed for TC ≥200 mg/dL (16.9%); HDL {\&}lt;35 mg/dL (3.3%); and non-HDL ≥130 mg/dL (27.8%), ≥160 mg/dL (10.6%), and ≥190 mg/dL (3.3%). Lipid-lowering medications were started on 23 patients. In mixed model longitudinal data analyses, HbA1c was significantly related to TC and non-HDL. Body mass index z-score was inversely related to HDL. Conclusions In this retrospective, longitudinal study of pediatric patients with T1D with repeated lipid measurements, sustained abnormal levels for TC, HDL, and non-HDL were present. Prospective longitudinal data for dyslipidemia in youth with T1D are needed.},

A total of 1029 patients (mean age at onset, 18 years; male/female ratio, 1.2), 575 control subjects and 179 nuclear families were analyzed for the −308 SNP and 1082 patients (mean age at onset, 17 years; and male/female ratio, 1.3), 606 control subjects, and 261 nuclear families were analyzed for the TNFa microsatellite marker. All subjects were typed initially for HLA-DQ. No primary association was detected with the −308 G/A promoter SNP. In contrast, we found evidence of a contribution of TNFa1 allele to susceptibility for T1D independently of HLA-DQ. We observed that the conserved HLA-DQ-TNFa extended haplotype, HLA-DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201-TNFa1 is a diabetogenic haplotype in the Belgian population and is independent of age at onset and gender and confers an estimated relative risk of 4.55 and an absolute risk of 1.7%. In conclusion, our observations suggest that the−308 G/A promoter SNP is not a genetic marker for T1D, but that the TNFa microsatellite may have an added value to further refine the immunogenetic risk conferred by the HLA-DQ region in the Belgian population.},

Because abnormal antigen processing, in part characterized by altered class I processing, has been identified in patients with IDDM, the TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) genes located in the HLA class II region make attractive candidate genes for IDDM. Five coding region variants of TAP1 were typed in a cohort of well characterized Finnish patients with diabetes (n = 119) and compared to racially matched control subjects (n = 92). We found that although no single TAP1 polymorphism was associated with IDDM, a genotypic combination of Ile/ Val at codon 333 with Asp/Asp at codon 637 was found more frequently in subjects with IDDM (9.4%) compared to controls (1.2%; p = 0.025). This could not be accounted for by an association with any particular haplotype defined by class I or class II serology.},

Interleukin (IL)-12 is a potent immunoregulatory molecule that is a key determinant of T-cell differentiation into Th1 cells, and has been implicated in the development of IDDM. To investigate the role of IL-12 that is locally produced by islet-infiltrating cells in the development of IDDM, we generated transgenic NOD mice in which the IL-12 p40 homodimer, a natural antagonist of IL-12, was produced exclusively in islets without affecting the levels of IL-12 p40 in the systemic circulation. We found that the incidence of diabetes was significantly reduced in these transgenic mice. These results clearly demonstrate that IL-12 locally produced by islet-infiltrating cells plays a critical role in the development of IDDM.},

Exploiting a natural phenomenon observed in tumors, plasmid DNA encoding for a soluble ligand to NKG2D (sRAE-1$\gamma$) was isolated and engineered into a plasmid expression system. A polymeric gene delivery system was developed to deliver the soluble RAE-1 plasmid to the pancreatic islets. The bioreducible cationic polymer poly(cystamine bisacrylamide‐diamino hexane) (p(CBA-DAH)) was modified with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and the targeting peptide CHVLWSTRC, known to target the EphA2 and EphA4 receptors. We observed a higher uptake of the targeting polymer Eph-PEG-p(CBA-DAH) in the pancreas of NOD mice compared to non-targeting controls. To evaluate the efficacy of preventing diabetes, the Eph-PEG-p(CBA-DAH)/RAE-1 complex (polyplex) was intravenously injected into 6-week-old female NOD mice. Within 17{\&}{\#}xa0;weeks blood glucose levels were stabilized in animals injected with polyplex, while those treated without therapeutic plasmid developed progressive hyperglycemia. Additionally, the degree of insulitis and the infiltration of CD8+ T-cells in the polyplex treated group were improved over the targeting polymer only treated group. The current study suggests that the therapy of the Eph-PEG-p (CBA-DAH) delivering therapeutic sRAE-1 gene may be used to protect $\beta$-cells from autoimmune destruction and prevent type-1 diabetes.},

abstract = {Type 1 diabetes (T1D) satisfies many of the criteria for an autoimmune disease. The impact of the environment to promote the development of T1D and the ability to identify individuals at risk for T1D years before clinical presentation afford lessons for other autoimmune diseases, in regard to gene--environment interactions and the potential for rational approaches to pre-clinical diagnosis and prevention. Public health measures aimed at the modern pro-inflammatory environment are required to stem the rising tide not only of T1D but other autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders. In the non-obese diabetic (NOD) model of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, compelling evidence indicates that adaptive autoimmunity to the pancreatic beta cell is initially targeted against proinsulin. Proof-of-principle studies in the NOD mouse, which established that insulin and proinsulin peptides could be applied as tools to induce immune tolerance and protect against diabetes development, await successful translation to at-risk humans. Initial trials of insulin-specific immunotherapy in humans show promise and reveal ways of optimising this approach that are also applicable to other autoimmune diseases.},

The Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) has followed children at increased risk of T1D since 1993. Of the 1692 DAISY children genotyped for VDR rs1544410, VDR rs2228570, VDR rs11568820, PTPN2 rs1893217, and PTPN2 rs478582, 111 developed IA, defined as positivity for GAD, insulin or IA-2 autoantibodies on 2 or more consecutive visits, and 38 IA positive children progressed to T1D. Proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted. There was no association between IA development and any of the gene variants, nor was there evidence of a VDR*PTPN2 interaction. Progression to T1D in IA positive children was associated with the VDR rs2228570 GG genotype (HR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.26--0.92) and there was an interaction between VDR rs1544410 and PTPN2 rs1893217 (pinteraction{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.02). In children with the PTPN2 rs1893217 AA genotype, the VDR rs1544410 AA/AG genotype was associated with a decreased risk of T1D (HR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.11--0.53, p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.0004), while in children with the PTPN2 rs1893217 GG/GA genotype, the VDR rs1544410 AA/AG genotype was not associated with T1D (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 0.43--4.06, p{\&}{\#}xa0;={\&}{\#}xa0;0.62).

Treg cell expansion required cell-to-cell contact and Notch3 signaling, which was mediated selectively through the Notch ligand Jagged2 expressed by the multipotent HPC subset, as assessed by small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing. Conversely, notwithstanding their similar multilineage microchimerism, neither sorted Jagged2− HPCs nor Jagged2lo medullary HSCs were able to expand Treg cells. These data provide evidence for a productive Notch-mediated interaction between a unique subset of mobilized hematopoietic progenitors and Treg cells. They open therapeutic perspectives for autologous transplantation of Jagged2+ LSK progenitors to promote Treg cell expansion in T cell-mediated diseases.},

This study examined NOD mice with (NOD+) and without (NOD−) insulin-dependent diabetes, and control strain (ILI) mice for evidence of hyperalgesia to a noxious thermal stimulus. Interestingly, both NOD+ and NOD− mice showed reduced mean hindpaw withdrawal latencies when compared with non-diabetic ILI mice. NOD+ and NOD− mice were also abnormal in their general appearance, activity level, posture, gait and muscle bulk when compared with ILI mice. These findings raise the possibility that hyperalgesia in insulin-dependent NOD mice, or insulin-dependent humans with Type 1 diabetes, may be independent of diabetes and due to a primary disturbance within sensory pathways.},

The Foxp3+ iTreg cell repertoire is drawn from naive conventional CD4+ T cells, whereas natural Treg (nTreg) cells are selected by high-avidity interactions in the thymus. The full extent of differences and similarities between iTreg and nTreg cells is yet to be defined. We speculate that iTreg cell development is driven by the need to maintain a noninflammatory environment in the gut, to suppress immune responses to environmental and food allergens, and to decrease chronic inflammation, whereas nTreg cells prevent autoimmunity and raise the activation threshold for all immune responses.},

abstract = {Impaired wound healing is a common complication of diabetes mellitus. The underlying pathophysiology of diabetes-impaired healing is poorly understood. In the present study we have compared cell proliferation rates, apoptosis (programmed cell death), the myofibroblast marker $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin and procollagen I mRNA expression, between diabetic and control mice. Full-thickness skin wounds were made in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and C57B6 controls. NOD mice showed a marked retardation of wound healing at both 7 and 14 days after wounding. Comparison of cell proliferation rates 7 days after wounding, using 5-bromo-2′-deoxy-Uridine incorporation, showed higher rates of cell proliferation in controls (88.1 $\pm$ 12.8) than in NOD wounds (52.1 $\pm$ 9.9, p {\&}lt; 0.02, n= 4). Immunohistochemical detection of $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin, showed a later onset in diabetic wounds, suggesting that wound contraction may be delayed in the diabetic animals. In situ hybridisation for $\alpha$1(I) procollagen mRNA expression, showed reduced procollagen I expression in the diabetic wounds when compared with controls. Lastly, there appeared to be higher levels of apoptosis in diabetic wounds, shown by the terminal transferase mediated UTP nick end-labelling technique. Apoptotic cells were rare in control wounds confirming previous studies, which showed that apoptosis occurs late in normal wound healing as the wound matures into scar tissue. In conclusion, we hypothesize that reduced cell proliferation, retarded onset of the myofibroblast phenotype, reduced procollagen I mRNA expression and aberrant control of apoptotic cell death may contribute to impaired wound healing seen in this diabetic model.},

abstract = {Insulin-dependent diabetes (IDD), being an autoimmune disease, offers several opportunities for immunological interventions that may result either in the reduction of disease severity or in delaying diabetes onset. Among the various experimental preventative approaches, parenteral immunization with islet-specific autoantigens appears to be practically simpler and promising. We have previously shown that immunization with insulin, insulin B chain and B chain epitope (p9--23), but not insulin A chain, in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) and in alum (with B chain) delayed/prevented diabetes onset in NOD mice. Here we demonstrate the protective efficacy of affinity purified GAD65in IFA. While both insulin B chain and GAD65significantly delayed the onset of diabetes (P=0.001), a recently described tyrosine phosphatase (IA--2) antigen did not (P=0.38). Interestingly, B chain immunization reduced the incidence of cyclophosphamide (CY)-accelerated diabetes by about 50--55%. We also provide further evidence that B chain, upon increased adsorption to alum, could improve on its protective capacity in NOD mice.},

abstract = {Numerous hypotheses have been put forward to explain the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue and stroma. The immune system participates in the homeostasis of the peritoneal cavity, and modifications in its functioning have been advanced to explain endometriosis and its consequences. Recently, the powerful anti-inflammatory effect of progesterone was recognized as a potential causal factor for endometriosis and could contribute to the autoimmune nature of endometriosis, as well as to more specific local and systemic changes. Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are a diverse group of complex diseases characterized by loss of self-tolerance causing immune-mediated tissue destruction. Just as in autoimmune diseases, in endometriosis similar immunologic alterations occur, such as an increase in the number and cytotoxicity of macrophages, polyclonal increase in the activity of B lymphocytes, abnormalities in the functions and concentrations of B and T lymphocytes, and reduction in number or activity of natural killer cells. Furthermore, the presence of specific antiendometrial and antiovary antibodies was found both in endometriosis and infertility. Genetic factors play a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, and autoimmunity genes are therefore reasonable candidate genes for endometriosis and endometriosis-associated infertility. Single nucleotide polymorphisms are common in the human genome and affect the function of crucial components of the T-cell--antigen-receptor signaling pathways; they could have profound effects on the function of the immune system and thus on the development of autoimmune diseases. Here, we conducted a critical medical literature review about the possible role of genetic variants in autoimmune-related genes in the development of endometriosis.},

abstract = {Summary The transcription factor Foxp3 is essential for the development of regulatory T (Treg) cells, yet its expression is insufficient for establishing the Treg cell lineage. Here we showed that Treg cell development was achieved by the combination of two independent processes, i.e., the expression of Foxp3 and the establishment of Treg cell-specific CpG hypomethylation pattern. Both events were induced by T cell receptor stimulation. The Treg cell-type CpG hypomethylation began in the thymus and continued to proceed in the periphery and could be fully established without Foxp3. The hypomethylation was required for Foxp3+ T cells to acquire Treg cell-type gene expression, lineage stability, and full suppressive activity. Thus, those T cells in which the two events have concurrently occurred are developmentally set into the Treg cell lineage. This model explains how Treg cell fate and plasticity is controlled and can be exploited to generate functionally stable Treg cells.},

abstract = {Mounting evidence indicates that immunosuppressive therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation are relatively inefficient approaches to treat autoimmune diabetes. In this study we assessed the impact of immunosuppression on inflammatory insulitis in NOD mice, and the effect of radiation on immunomodulation mediated by adoptive transfer of various cell subsets. Sublethal radiation of NOD females at the age of 14 weeks (onset of hyperglycemia) delayed the onset of hyperglycemia, however two thirds of the mice became diabetic. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes into irradiated NON and NOD mice precipitated disease onset despite increased contents of CD25+FoxP3+ T cells in the pancreas and regional lymphatics. Similar phenotypic changes were observed when CD25+ T cells were infused after radiation, which also delayed disease onset without affecting its incidence. Importantly, irradiation increased the susceptibility to diabetes in NOD and NON mice (71--84%) as compared to immunomodulation with splenocytes and CD25+ T cells in na{\"\i}ve recipients (44--50%). Although irradiation had significant and durable influence on pancreatic infiltrates and the fractions of functional CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells were elevated by adoptive cell transfer, this approach conferred no protection from disease progression. Irradiation was ineffective both in debulking of pathogenic clones and in restoring immune homeostasis, and the consequent homeostatic expansion evolves as an unfavorable factor in attempts to restore self-tolerance and might even provoke uncontrolled proliferation of pathogenic clones. The obstacles imposed by immunosuppression on abrogation of autoimmune insulitis require replacement of non-specific immunosuppressive therapy by selective immunomodulation that does not cause lymphopenia.},

In this study, we examined whether the development of diabetes and insulitis in female non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice could be affected by prophylactic administration of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), which shares structural homology with insulin and has insulin-like metabolic effects. Two experiments which differed in duration and dosage of IGF-I treatment were carried out. In the first experiment, animals were treated from 4 to 9 weeks of age with IGF-I (17.9 nmol/day at 4--5 weeks of age and 35.9 nmol/day at 6--9 weeks of age) and observed up to 34 weeks of age. In the second experiment, the animals were treated from 4 to 34 weeks of age with IGF-I (1.79 nmol/day at 4--5 weeks of age, 3.59 nmol/day at 6--9 weeks of age, and 5.38 nmol/day at 10--34 weeks of age). The former treatment could significantly delay the onset of diabetes (P {\&}lt; 0.05) and decrease the insulitis score at 10 weeks of age (P {\&}lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the latter treatment did not affect the incidence of diabetes, the age at onset or the insulitis score. Our results suggest that the IGF-I treatment at the early age may provide protection against autoimmune $\beta$-cell destruction in NOD mice.},

abstract = {The relationship between increased risk in relatives over population prevalence (lambda R = KR/K) and probability of sharing zero marker alleles identical by descent (ibd) at a linked locus (such as HLA) by an affected relative pair is examined. For a model assuming a single disease-susceptibility locus or group of loci tightly linked to a marker locus, the relationship is remarkably simple and general. Namely, if phi R is the prior probability for the relative pair to share zero marker alleles identical by descent, then P (sharing 0 markers/both relatives are affected) is just phi R/lambda R. Alternatively, lambda AR, the increased risk over population prevalence to a relative R due to a disease locus tightly linked to marker locus A, equals the prior probability that the relative pair share zero A alleles ibd divided by the posterior probability that they share zero alleles ibd, given that they are both affected. For example, for affected sib pairs, P (sharing 0 markers/both sibs are affected) = .25/lambda S. This formula holds true for any number of alleles at the disease locus and for their frequencies, penetrances, and population prevalence. Similar formulas are derived for sharing one and two markers. Application of these formulas to several well-studied HLA-associated diseases yields the following results: For multiple sclerosis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and coeliac disease, a single-locus model of disease susceptibility is rejected, implying the existence of additional unlinked familial determinants. For all three diseases, the effect of the HLA-linked locus on familiality is minor: for multiple sclerosis, it accounts for only a 2.5-fold increased risk to sibs over the population prevalence, compared to an observed value of 20; for coeliac disease, it accounts for approximately a 5.25-fold increased risk to sibs, while the observed value is on the order of 60; for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, it accounts for a 3.42-fold increased risk in sibs, while the observed value is 15. In all cases, the secondary determinants must be outside the HLA region. For tuberculoid leprosy, an unlinked familial determinant is also implicated (increased risk to sibs due to HLA = 1.49; observed value = 2.38). For hemochromatosis and Hodgkin's disease, there is little evidence for HLA-unlinked familial determinants. With this formula, it is also possible to examine the hypothesis of pleiotropy versus linkage dis-equilibrium by comparing lambda AS with the increased risk to sibs due to the associated allele(s).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

We defined the diabetes status of all siblings of all probands who are included in the nationwide register of Finnish cases for whom type 1 diabetes was diagnosed before age 18 years between 1965 and 1979. Siblings' diabetes status was ascertained by a record search of nationwide registries through 2001, and the type of diabetes and date of its manifestation were obtained from medical records. The total number of person-years during the follow-up was 405,685. Of the 10,168 siblings at risk, 647 (6.4%) had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes by 2001. The cumulative incidence of type 1 diabetes by ages 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 years in all siblings was 1.5, 4.1, 5.5, 6.4, and 6.9%, respectively. A young age at diagnosis in the index case, paternal young-onset diabetes, male sex, and older parental age at delivery considerably increased the risk of type 1 diabetes for siblings. This large prospective family study of type 1 diabetes in siblings of childhood-onset diabetic patients provides reliable empirical estimates for the sibling recurrence risk.},

abstract = {Our aim is to review methods to optimize detection of all disease genes in a genetic region. As a starting point, we assume there is sufficient evidence from linkage and/or association studies, based on significance levels or replication studies, for the involvement in disease risk of the genetic region under study. For closely linked markers, there will often be multiple associations with disease, and linkage analyses identify a region rather than the specific disease‐predisposing gene. Hence, the first task is to identify the primary (major) disease‐predisposing gene or genes in a genetic region, and single nucleotide polymorphisms thereof, that is, how to distinguish true associations from those that are just due to linkage disequilibrium with the actual disease‐predisposing variants. Then, how do we detect additional disease genes in this genetic region? These two issues are of course very closely interrelated. No existing programs, either individually or in aggregate, can handle the magnitude and complexity of the analyses needed using currently available methods. Further, even with modern computers, one cannot study every possible combination of genetic markers and their haplotypes across the genome, or even within a genetic region. Although we must rely heavily on computers, in the final analysis of multiple effects in a genetic region and/or interaction or independent effects between unlinked genes, manipulation of the data by the individual investigator will play a crucial role. We recommend a multistrategy approach using a variety of complementary methods described below.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Clustering is a widely applicable pattern recognition method for discovering groups of similar observations in data. While there are a large variety of clustering algorithms, very few of these can enforce constraints on the variation of attributes for data points included in a given cluster. In particular, a clustering algorithm that can limit variation within a cluster according to that cluster's position (centroid location) can produce effective and optimal results in many important applications ranging from clustering of silicon pixels or calorimeter cells in high-energy physics to label-free liquid chromatography based mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data analysis in proteomics and metabolomics.

RESULTS:We present MEDEA (M-Estimator with DEterministic Annealing), an M-estimator based, new unsupervised algorithm that is designed to enforce position-specific constraints on variance during the clustering process. The utility of MEDEA is demonstrated by applying it to the problem of "peak matching"--identifying the common LC-MS peaks across multiple samples--in proteomic biomarker discovery. Using real-life datasets, we show that MEDEA not only outperforms current state-of-the-art model-based clustering methods, but also results in an implementation that is significantly more efficient, and hence applicable to much larger LC-MS data sets.

CONCLUSIONS:MEDEA is an effective and efficient solution to the problem of peak matching in label-free LC-MS data. The program implementing the MEDEA algorithm, including datasets, clustering results, and supplementary information is available from the author website at http://www.hephy.at/user/fru/medea/.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE:Type 1 diabetes usually has a preclinical phase identified by circulating islet autoantibodies, but the rate of progression to diabetes after seroconversion to islet autoantibodies is uncertain.

OBJECTIVE:To determine the rate of progression to diabetes after islet autoantibody seroconversion.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:Data were pooled from prospective cohort studies performed in Colorado (recruitment, 1993-2006), Finland (recruitment, 1994-2009), and Germany (recruitment, 1989-2006) examining children genetically at risk for type 1 diabetes for the development of insulin autoantibodies, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) autoantibodies, insulinoma antigen 2 (IA2) autoantibodies, and diabetes. Participants were all children recruited and followed up in the 3 studies (Colorado, 1962; Finland, 8597; Germany, 2818). Follow-up assessment in each study was concluded by July 2012.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:The primary analysis was the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children with 2 or more autoantibodies. The secondary analysis was the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children with 1 autoantibody or no autoantibodies.

RESULTS:Progression to type 1 diabetes at 10-year follow-up after islet autoantibody seroconversion in 585 children with multiple islet autoantibodies was 69.7% (95% CI, 65.1%-74.3%), and in 474 children with a single islet autoantibody was 14.5% (95% CI, 10.3%-18.7%). Risk of diabetes in children who had no islet autoantibodies was 0.4% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.6%) by the age of 15 years. Progression to type 1 diabetes in the children with multiple islet autoantibodies was faster for children who had islet autoantibody seroconversion younger than age 3 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.65 [95% CI, 1.30-2.09; P < .001]; 10-year risk, 74.9% [95% CI, 69.7%-80.1%]) vs children 3 years or older (60.9% [95% CI, 51.5%-70.3%]); for children with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype DR3/DR4-DQ8 (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.09-1.68; P = .007]; 10-year risk, 76.6% [95% CI, 69.2%-84%]) vs other HLA genotypes (66.2% [95% CI, 60.2%-72.2%]); and for girls (HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.04-1.58; P = .02];10-year risk, 74.8% [95% CI, 68.0%-81.6%]) vs boys (65.7% [95% CI, 59.3%-72.1%]).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:The majority of children at risk of type 1 diabetes who had multiple islet autoantibody seroconversion progressed to diabetes over the next 15 years. Future prevention studies should focus on this high-risk population.},

High levels of immunoglobulin (Ig), specifically, IgM and IgA, and a low level of IgG were reported in adult patients; however no studies have analyzed the increasing incidence in relation to Ig levels. Our aim was to describe Ig in children newly diagnosed with diabetes and in their healthy siblings. Children with T1D expressed significantly lower IgG (p {\&}lt; 0.01) and higher IgA levels (p = 0.045), whereas no differences in IgE or IgM (p {\&}gt; 0.5) levels were found. Age-specific levels were unchanged over a 9-year period. In patients and siblings IgG, IgA and IgE increased by age (p {\&}lt; 0.001); which was in contrast to IgM (p {\&}gt; 0.05). The continued increase in IgG levels by age indicates that adult levels are reached later than in previously studied cohorts, thereby indicating a slower maturation of the immune system.},

abstract = {During pregnancy, the fetus represents a natural allograft that is not normally rejected. While the maternal immune system retains the ability to respond to foreign antigens, tolerance mechanisms are up-regulated to protect the fetus from immunologic attacks by the mother. The profound immunologic adaptations during and after pregnancy do influence maternal autoimmune rheumatic diseases in several ways. One is triggering the onset of a rheumatic disease in the post partum period, the other influencing disease activity of established rheumatic disease. The review will discuss the mechanisms of increased susceptibility of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the first year post partum with a specific emphasis on the role of fetal cells or antigens persisting in the maternal circulation (so called microchimerism). Furthermore, the different influences of pregnancy on established rheumatic diseases will be highlighted. A marked beneficial effect of pregnancy is observed on RA whereas several other rheumatic diseases as ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) show either no p]articular effect or an aggravation of symptoms during pregnancy. Differences emerging in regard to modulation of disease symptoms during pregnancy seem related to response to hormones, the type of cytokine profile and immune response prevailing as well as further downstream interactions of molecular pathways that are important in disease pathogenesis.},

The role of T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines in the immunopathogenesis of disease is not understood. IL-10 has presented a particularly paradoxical role. Transgenic (Tg) BALB/c mice expressing IL-10 in the pancreas exhibited periinsulitis but not insulitis and diabetes. However, backcrossing of these Tg mice with NOD mice accelerated the onset of diabetes, indicating a pathogenic role for IL-10 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes since it is able to replace the genetic susceptibility information on the NOD genome. Conversely, administration of IL-10 to adult NOD delayed the onset of and decreased the incidence of diabetes suggesting a potential therapeutic role for IL-10 in autoimmune diabetes. Overall, the findings indicated a paradoxical role for IL-10 in the immunoregulation of autoimmune diabetes.},

abstract = {Interleukin-3 (IL-3), a multilineage colony stimulating factor, has been shown to augment alloreactive bone marrow-derived suppressor cell activity in vivo and in vitro. The present study examined the effect of IL-3 on autoimmune-mediated diabetes in NOD mice. Administration of IL-3 twice weekly starting at 2--4 weeks of age delayed the onset and reduced the overall incidence of diabetes. Bone marrow cells obtained from IL-3-treated NOD mice protected NOD mice from cyclophosphamide-induced diabetes but failed to prevent adoptively transferred diabetes. In vitro culture of bone marrow cells in medium containing IL-3 produced a Thy-1+CD3$\epsilon$loCD4−CD8−CD25−immature T cell clone which prevented cyclophosphamide-induced diabetes. The cloned cells also effectively delayed the development of diabetes induced by transfer of T cells in adult thymectomized, irradiated, bone marrow-reconstituted NOD mice. These results suggest that IL-3 is capable of regulating extrathymic T cell development from the bone marrow and that these cells mediate strong immunoregulatory function.},

abstract = {Various therapeutic strategies have been developed to tolerize autoreactive T cells and prevent autoimmune pathology in type 1 diabetes. 4-1BB, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, is a costimulatory receptor primarily expressed on activated T cells. The administration of an agonistic anti-4-1BB antibody (2A) dramatically reduced the incidence and severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Treatment with the same antibody in Fas-deficient MRL/lpr mice blocked lymphadenopathy and lupus-like autoimmune processes. Paradoxically, transgenic non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice overexpressing membrane-bound agonistic single-chain anti-4-1BB Fv in pancreatic $\beta$ cells developed more severe diabetes than their non-transgenic littermates, with earlier onset, faster diabetic processes, and higher mortality. Forty percent of transgenic mice developed diabetes by 4 weeks of age, compared with their control littermates, which first exhibited diabetes at 14 weeks. The frequency of diabetes in female transgenics reached 70% by 8 weeks of age. Most female transgenic mice died around 12 weeks. Consistent with this, transgenic mice developed earlier and more severe insulitis and showed stronger GAD-specific T-cell responses, compared with age-matched control littermates. Our results indicate an adverse effect of transgenic anti-4-1BB scFv in NOD mice and suggest a potential risk of this anti-4-1BB-based immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases.},

abstract = {The NOD mouse is a recognized model for studying immunologically mediated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). In most colonies, the disease appears with a greater preponderance in females than in males and castration alters the expression of the disease. The prevalence of diabetes may also vary depending upon environmental factors such as stress. Therefore, we measured in the NOD mouse serum glucocorticoid concentrations in basal and stress conditions. We observed in NOD as well as in C57BL/6 mice, taken as controls, a circadian rhythm of corticosterone, with females having higher values than males. After a single restraint stress, female and male NOD mice exhibit a comparable response, whereas after repeated stress, males respond significantly less than females, suggesting an adaptation phenomenon. In contrast, there is no difference in the pattern of corticosterone response of C57BL/6 females and males to both types of stress, but females always respond better than males. Moreover, whatever the stress considered, NOD mice generally exhibit a higher corticosterone response than C57BL/6 mice. The sexual dimorphism in diabetes expression in NOD mice may be related to the levels of corticosterone, a hyperglycemic hormone, in both basal and stress conditions. However, the understanding of corticosteroid effects in this model of type I IDDM is rather complex given their well known anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects in other models of autoimmune diseases.},

abstract = {Non-obese-diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop type I diabetes. The disease starts with T cells infiltrating the islets of Langerhans. We therefore examined the T-cell receptor (TCR) V$\beta$ region repertoire in islet infiltrates from individual female NOD mice from 4 to 10 week old by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using V$\beta$1-V$\beta$17 specific oligonucleotides. The study revealed a limited heterogeneity of TCR V$\beta$ transcripts with a predominance of V$\beta$1 at the onset of insulitis, i.e. at 4 weeks of age. The TCR VDJ$\beta$ sequences of the V$\beta$1 PCR fragments were identical in most of the individual mice. Among several different mice, similarities in the $\beta$-junctional regions were detected. In contrast, a large heterogeneity of TCR V$\beta$ usage was found in mice with advanced insulitis, i.e., from 6 weeks of age on. Thus, these data suggest a limited heterogeneity of TCR V$\beta$ usage with a predominance of V$\beta$1 at the initiation phase of the disease.},

abstract = {Dopamine receptors have five isoforms, termed D1--D5. The D1 and D5 receptors form the D1-like group that couples with the G$\alpha$s class of G proteins, while D2, D3 and D4 form the D2-like group that couples with the G$\alpha$i class of G proteins. In our previous studies, a D1-like-R antagonist, SCH23390, inhibited DC-mediated Th17 differentiation and exhibited preventive and therapeutic effects on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. We herein demonstrate in the current study that in the pancreas obtained from NOD mice, islet infiltrates appear to be composed of mononuclear cells positive for IL-23R, one of the specific markers for Th17. Thereafter, NOD mice were orally administered SCH23390 from week 6 to week 26. At week 26, 67% and 25% of mice developed diabetes in the control and the SCH23390 groups, respectively (p{\&}{\#}xa0;{\&}lt;{\&}{\#}xa0;0.05). A histological examination of SCH23390-treated mice exhibited a typical normal islet structure with no signs of periductal and perivascular infiltrates, whereas the islets from vehicle controls showed insulitis. In week 26, spleen cells were re-stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in vitro and exhibited an augmentation of IFN$\gamma$ induction and the suppression of IL-17 induction in the SCH23390-treated mice. These findings indicate that antagonizing D1-like-R suppresses IL-17 expression, thereby leading to a decreased occurrence of NOD.},

abstract = {Pro-apoptotic cytokines are toxic to the pancreatic $\beta$-cells and have been associated with the pathogenesis of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Proteome analysis of IL-1$\beta$ exposed isolated rat islets identified galectin-3 (gal-3) as the most up-regulated protein. Here analysis of human and rat islets and insulinoma cells confirmed IL-1$\beta$ regulated gal-3 expression of several gal-3 isoforms and a complex in vivo expression profile during diabetes development in rats. Over-expression of gal-3 protected $\beta$-cells against IL-1$\beta$ toxicity, with a complete blockage of JNK phosphorylation, essential for IL-1-mediated apoptosis. Mutation scanning of regulatory and coding regions of the gal-3 gene (LGALS3) identified six polymorphisms. A haplotype comprising three cSNPs showed significantly increased transmission to unaffected offspring in 257 T1D families and replicated in an independent set of 170 T1D families. In summary, combined proteome--transcriptome--genome and functional analyses identify gal-3 as a candidate gene/protein in T1D susceptibility that may prove valuable in future intervention/prevention strategies.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma is the most common and deadly brain tumor, possibly arising from genetic and epigenetic alterations in normal astroglial cells. Multiple cytogenetic, chromosomal, and genetic alterations have been identified in glioblastoma, with distinct expression of antigens (Ags) and biomarkers that may alter therapeutic potential of this aggressive cancer. Current therapy consists of surgical resection, followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In spite of these treatments, the prognosis for glioblastoma patients is poor. Although recent studies have focused on the development of novel immunotherapeutics against glioblastoma, little is known about glioblastoma-specific immune responses. A better understanding of the molecular interactions among glioblastoma tumors, host immune cells, and the tumor microenvironment may give rise to novel integrated approaches for the simultaneous control of tumor escape pathways and the activation of antitumor immune responses. This review provides a detailed overview concerning genetic alterations in glioblastoma, their effects on Ag and biomarker expression, and the future design of chemoimmunotherapeutics against glioblastoma.},

A total of 1715 SNPs from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium GWA study of type I diabetes (T1D) were selected and a follow-up study was conducted in 1410 affected sib-pair families assembled by the Type I Diabetes Genetics Consortium. In addition to the support for previously identified loci (PTPN22/1p13; ERBB3/12q13; SH2B3/12q24; CLEC16A/16p13; UBASH3A/21q22), evidence supporting two new and distinct chromosome locations associated with T1D was observed: FHOD3/18q12 (rs2644261, P=5.9 x 10(-4)) and Xp22 (rs5979785, P=6.8 x 10(-3); http://www.T1DBase.org). There was independent support for both SNPs in a GWA meta-analysis of 7514 cases and 9045 controls (P values=5.0 x 10(-3) and 6.7 x 10(-6), respectively). The chromosome 18q12 region contains four genes, none of which are obvious functional candidate genes. In contrast, the Xp22 SNP is located 30 kb centromeric of the functional candidate genes TLR8 and TLR7 genes. Both TLR8 and TLR7 are functional candidate genes owing to their key roles as pathogen recognition receptors and, in the case of TLR7, overexpression has been associated directly with murine autoimmune disease.},

Here we demonstrate the ability to simultaneously detect activated kinase members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases family (p38 MAPK, p44/42 MAPK, JNK/SAPK), members of cell survival pathways (AKT/PKB), and members of T-cell activation pathways (TYK2), among others, in subpopulations of complex cell populations by multiparameter flow-cytometric analysis. We demonstrate the utility of these probes in identifying distinct signaling cascades for (1) both artificial and physiological stimulatory conditions of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), (2) cytokine stimulation in human memory and na{\"\i}ve lymphocyte subsets as identified by five differentiation markers, and (3) ordering of kinase activation in potential signaling hierarchies. Polychromatic flow-cytometric active kinase measurements demonstrate that multidimensional analysis of signaling pathways can provide functional signaling pathway assessment on a single-cell level and allow for potential correlation with biological and clinical parameters.},

abstract = {Motivation: An important problem in systems biology is the inference of biochemical pathways and regulatory networks from postgenomic data. Various reverse engineering methods have been proposed in the literature, and it is important to understand their relative merits and shortcomings. In the present paper, we compare the accuracy of reconstructing gene regulatory networks with three different modelling and inference paradigms: (1) Relevance networks (RNs): pairwise association scores independent of the remaining network; (2) graphical Gaussian models (GGMs): undirected graphical models with constraint-based inference, and (3) Bayesian networks (BNs): directed graphical models with score-based inference. The evaluation is carried out on the Raf pathway, a cellular signalling network describing the interaction of 11 phosphorylated proteins and phospholipids in human immune system cells. We use both laboratory data from cytometry experiments as well as data simulated from the gold-standard network. We also compare passive observations with active interventions.Results: On Gaussian observational data, BNs and GGMs were found to outperform RNs. The difference in performance was not significant for the non-linear simulated data and the cytoflow data, though. Also, we did not observe a significant difference between BNs and GGMs on observational data in general. However, for interventional data, BNs outperform GGMs and RNs, especially when taking the edge directions rather than just the skeletons of the graphs into account. This suggests that the higher computational costs of inference with BNs over GGMs and RNs are not justified when using only passive observations, but that active interventions in the form of gene knockouts and over-expressions are required to exploit the full potential of BNs.},

Bayesian networks have been suggested for learning gene regulatory networks from observational data. Not all causal relationships can be inferred from correlation data alone. Often several equivalent but different directed graphs explain the data equally well. Intervention experiments where genes are manipulated can help to narrow down the range of possible networks. RESULTS: We describe an active learning algorithm that suggests an optimized sequence of intervention experiments. Simulation experiments show that our selection scheme is better than an unguided choice of interventions in learning the correct network and compares favorably in running time and results with methods based on value of information calculations.},

abstract = {Combined analyses of gene networks and DNA sequence variation can provide new insights into the aetiology of common diseases that may not be apparent from genome-wide association studies alone. Recent advances in rat genomics are facilitating systems-genetics approaches. Here we report the use of integrated genome-wide approaches across seven rat tissues to identify gene networks and the loci underlying their regulation. We defined an interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-driven inflammatory network (IDIN) enriched for viral response genes, which represents a molecular biomarker for macrophages and which was regulated in multiple tissues by a locus on rat chromosome 15q25. We show that Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 2 (Ebi2, also known as Gpr183), which lies at this locus and controls B lymphocyte migration, is expressed in macrophages and regulates the IDIN. The human orthologous locus on chromosome 13q32 controlled the human equivalent of the IDIN, which was conserved in monocytes. IDIN genes were more likely to associate with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D)-a macrophage-associated autoimmune disease-than randomly selected immune response genes (P = 8.85 × 10(-6)). The human locus controlling the IDIN was associated with the risk of T1D at single nucleotide polymorphism rs9585056 (P = 7.0 × 10(-10); odds ratio, 1.15), which was one of five single nucleotide polymorphisms in this region associated with EBI2 (GPR183) expression. These data implicate IRF7 network genes and their regulatory locus in the pathogenesis of T1D.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) are organ-specific autoimmune disorders with significant heritability, part of which is conferred by shared alleles. For decades, the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) complex was the only known susceptibility locus for both T1D and MS, but loci outside the HLA complex harboring risk alleles have been discovered and fully replicated. A genome-wide association scan for MS risk genes and candidate gene association studies have previously described the IL2RA gene region as a shared autoimmune locus. In order to investigate whether autoimmunity risk at IL2RA was due to distinct or shared alleles, we performed a genetic association study of three IL2RA variants in a DNA collection of up to 9,407 healthy controls, 2,420 MS, and 6,425 T1D subjects as well as 1,303 MS parent/child trios. Here, we report "allelic heterogeneity" at the IL2RA region between MS and T1D. We observe an allele associated with susceptibility to one disease and risk to the other, an allele that confers susceptibility to both diseases, and an allele that may only confer susceptibility to T1D. In addition, we tested the levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2RA) in the serum from up to 69 healthy control subjects, 285 MS, and 1,317 T1D subjects. We demonstrate that multiple variants independently correlate with sIL-2RA levels.},

The gene encoding the alpha-chain of the IL-2 receptor, IL2RA, harbors alleles associated with risk to MS and other autoimmune diseases. In addition, IL2RA genetic variants correlate with the levels of a soluble form of the IL-2 receptor in subjects with type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Here, we show that the IL2RA genotypes differentially affects soluble IL-2RA (sIL-2RA) levels in MS cases vs healthy controls; the two variants associated with MS (rs12722489 and rs2104286) account for 15 and 18% of the total variance in log(10)-transformed sIL-2RA concentration in control subjects but less so in subjects with MS (2 and 5%), suggesting that perturbations associated with disease or treatment may influence sIL-2RA levels in subjects with MS. Whereas analyses demonstrate that sIL-2RA serum concentrations are a remarkably stable phenotype in both healthy controls and untreated MS subjects, a difference is observed between benign and malignant MS. These data indicate that, in addition to specific allelic variants at IL2RA, immunological perturbations associated with aggressive forms of the disease can influence sIL-2RA levels in serum of MS subjects. We also demonstrate, functionally, that sIL-2RA can inhibit IL-2 signaling, yet enhance T cell proliferation and expansion. In summary, we propose that before disease onset, strong genetic factors associated with disease risk dictate sIL-2RA levels that may be further modulated with onset of chronic systemic inflammation associated with MS.},

abstract = {Large intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of diverse cellular processes. Determining the function of individual lincRNAs remains a challenge. Recent advances in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and computational methods allow for an unprecedented analysis of such transcripts. Here, we present an integrative approach to define a reference catalog of >8000 human lincRNAs. Our catalog unifies previously existing annotation sources with transcripts we assembled from RNA-seq data collected from ∼4 billion RNA-seq reads across 24 tissues and cell types. We characterize each lincRNA by a panorama of >30 properties, including sequence, structural, transcriptional, and orthology features. We found that lincRNA expression is strikingly tissue-specific compared with coding genes, and that lincRNAs are typically coexpressed with their neighboring genes, albeit to an extent similar to that of pairs of neighboring protein-coding genes. We distinguish an additional subset of transcripts that have high evolutionary conservation but may include short ORFs and may serve as either lincRNAs or small peptides. Our integrated, comprehensive, yet conservative reference catalog of human lincRNAs reveals the global properties of lincRNAs and will facilitate experimental studies and further functional classification of these genes.},

abstract = {One of the most important goals of unsupervised learning is to discover meaningful clusters in data. Clustering algorithms strive to discover groups, or clusters, of data points which belong together because they are in some way similar.The research presented in this thesis focuses on using Bayesian statistical techniques to cluster data. We take a model-based Bayesian approach to defining a cluster, and evaluate cluster membership in this paradigm. Due to the fact that large data sets are increasingly common in practice, our aim is for the methods in this thesis to be efficient while still retaining the desirable properties which result from a Bayesian paradigm.We develop a Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering (BHC) algorithm which efficiently ad- dresses many of the drawbacks of traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms. The goal of BHC is to construct a hierarchical representation of the data, incorporating both finer to coarser grained clusters, in such a way that we can also make predictions about new data points, compare different hierarchies in a principled manner, and automati- cally discover interesting levels of the hierarchy to examine. BHC can also be viewed as a fast way of performing approximate inference in a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPM), one of the cornerstones of nonparametric Bayesian Statistics.We create a new framework for retrieving desired information from large data collec- tions, Bayesian Sets, using Bayesian clustering techniques. Unlike current retrieval methods, Bayesian Sets provides a principled framework which leverages the rich and subtle information provided by queries in the form of a set of examples. Whereas most clustering algorithms are completely unsupervised, here the query provides su- pervised hints or constraints as to the membership of a particular cluster. We call this ``clustering on demand'', since it involves forming a cluster once some elements of that cluster have been revealed. We use Bayesian Sets to develop a content-based image retrieval system. We also extend Bayesian Sets to a discriminative setting and use this to perform automated analogical reasoning.Lastly, we develop extensions of clustering in order to model data with more complex structure than that for which traditional clustering is intended. Clustering models traditionally assume that each data point belongs to one and only one cluster, and although they have proven to be a very powerful class of models, this basic assump- tion is somewhat limiting. For example, there may be overlapping regions where data points actually belong to multiple clusters, like movies which can each belong to mul- tiple genres. We extend traditional mixture models to create a statistical model for overlapping clustering, the Infinite Overlapping Mixture Model (IOMM), in a non- parametric Bayesian setting, using the Indian Buffet Process (IBP). We also develop a Bayesian Partial Membership model (BPM), which allows data points to have partial membership in multiple clusters via a continuous relaxation of a finite mixture model.},

Advances in developmental genetics, palaeontology and evolutionary developmental biology have recently shed light on the origins of some of the structures that most intrigued Charles Darwin, including animal eyes, tetrapod limbs and giant beetle horns. In each case, structures arose by the modification of pre-existing genetic regulatory circuits established in early metazoans. The deep homology of generative processes and cell-type specification mechanisms in animal development has provided the foundation for the independent evolution of a great variety of structures.},

abstract = {Background: A number of methods that use both protein structural and evolutionary information are available to predict the functional consequences of missense mutations. However, many of these methods break down if either one of the two types of data are missing. Furthermore, there is a lack of rigorous assessment of how important the different factors are to prediction.Results: Here we use Bayesian networks to predict whether or not a missense mutation will affect the function of the protein. Bayesian networks provide a concise representation for inferring models from data, and are known to generalise well to new data. More importantly, they can handle the noisy, incomplete and uncertain nature of biological data. Our Bayesian network achieved comparable performance with previous machine learning methods. The predictive performance of learned model structures was no better than a naive Bayes classifier. However, analysis of the posterior distribution of model structures allows biologically meaningful interpretation of relationships between the input variables.Conclusion: The ability of the Bayesian network to make predictions when only structural or evolutionary data was observed allowed us to conclude that structural information is a significantly better predictor of the functional consequences of a missense mutation than evolutionary information, for the dataset used. Analysis of the posterior distribution of model structures revealed that the top three strongest connections with the class node all involved structural nodes. With this in mind, we derived a simplified Bayesian network that used just these three structural descriptors, with comparable performance to that of an all node network.},

abstract = {Motivation: Several recent methods have addressed the problem of heterogeneous data integration and network prediction by modeling the noise inherent in high-throughput genomic datasets, which can dramatically improve specificity and sensitivity and allow the robust integration of datasets with heterogeneous properties. However, experimental technologies capture different biological processes with varying degrees of success, and thus, each source of genomic data can vary in relevance depending on the biological process one is interested in predicting. Accounting for this variation can significantly improve network prediction, but to our knowledge, no previous approaches have explicitly leveraged this critical information about biological context.Results: We confirm the presence of context-dependent variation in functional genomic data and propose a Bayesian approach for context-sensitive integration and query-based recovery of biological process-specific networks. By applying this method to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that leveraging contextual information can significantly improve the precision of network predictions, including assignment for uncharacterized genes. We expect that this general context-sensitive approach can be applied to other organisms and prediction scenarios.Availability: A software implementation of our approach is available on request from the authors.Contact: ogt@genomics.princeton.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at http://avis.princeton.edu/contextPIXIE/.},

In this review, we describe the current computational approaches for the task, including direct methods, which propagate functional information through the network, and module-assisted methods, which infer functional modules within the network and use those for the annotation task. Although a broad variety of interesting approaches has been developed, further progress in the field will depend on systematic evaluation of the methods and their dissemination in the biological community.},

abstract = {Background: Protein interactions are crucial components of all cellular processes. Recently, high-throughput methods have been developed to obtain a global description of the interactome (the whole network of protein interactions for a given organism). In 2002, the yeast interactome was estimated to contain up to 80,000 potential interactions. This estimate is based on the integration of data sets obtained by various methods (mass spectrometry, two-hybrid methods, genetic studies). High-throughput methods are known, however, to yield a non-negligible rate of false positives, and to miss a fraction of existing interactions.The interactome can be represented as a graph where nodes correspond with proteins and edges with pairwise interactions. In recent years clustering methods have been developed and applied in order to extract relevant modules from such graphs. These algorithms require the specification of parameters that may drastically affect the results. In this paper we present a comparative assessment of four algorithms: Markov Clustering (MCL), Restricted Neighborhood Search Clustering (RNSC), Super Paramagnetic Clustering (SPC), and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE).Results: A test graph was built on the basis of 220 complexes annotated in the MIPS database. To evaluate the robustness to false positives and false negatives, we derived 41 altered graphs by randomly removing edges from or adding edges to the test graph in various proportions.Each clustering algorithm was applied to these graphs with various parameter settings, and the clusters were compared with the annotated complexes.We analyzed the sensitivity of the algorithms to the parameters and determined their optimal parameter values.We also evaluated their robustness to alterations of the test graph.We then applied the four algorithms to six graphs obtained from high-throughput experiments and compared the resulting clusters with the annotated complexes.Conclusion: This analysis shows that MCL is remarkably robust to graph alterations. In the tests of robustness, RNSC is more sensitive to edge deletion but less sensitive to the use of suboptimal parameter values. The other two algorithms are clearly weaker under most conditions.The analysis of high-throughput data supports the superiority of MCL for the extraction of complexes from interaction networks.},

abstract = {Background: Large-scale genomic studies based on transcriptome technologies provide clusters of genes that need to be functionally annotated. The Gene Ontology ( GO) implements a controlled vocabulary organised into three hierarchies: cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes. This terminology allows a coherent and consistent description of the knowledge about gene functions. The GO terms related to genes come primarily from semiautomatic annotations made by trained biologists ( annotation based on evidence) or text-mining of the published scientific literature ( literature profiling).Results: We report an original functional annotation method based on a combination of evidence and literature that overcomes the weaknesses and the limitations of each approach. It relies on the Gene Ontology Annotation database (GOA Human) and the PubGene biomedical literature index. We support these annotations with statistically associated GO terms and retrieve associative relations across the three GO hierarchies to emphasise the major pathways involved by a gene cluster. Both annotation methods and associative relations were quantitatively evaluated with a reference set of 7397 genes and a multi-cluster study of 14 clusters. We also validated the biological appropriateness of our hybrid method with the annotation of a single gene (cdc2) and that of a down-regulated cluster of 37 genes identified by a transcriptome study of an in vitro enterocyte differentiation model (CaCo-2 cells).Conclusion: The combination of both approaches is more informative than either separate approach: literature mining can enrich an annotation based only on evidence. Text-mining of the literature can also find valuable associated MEDLINE references that confirm the relevance of the annotation. Eventually, GO terms networks can be built with associative relations in order to highlight cooperative and competitive pathways and their connected molecular functions.},

abstract = {The complete set of mouse genes, as with the set of human genes, is still largely uncharacterized, with many pieces of experimental evidence accumulating regarding the activities and expression of the genes, but the majority of genes as yet still of unknown function. Within the context of the MouseFunc competition, we developed and applied two distinct large-scale data mining approaches to infer the functions (Gene Ontology annotations) of mouse genes from experimental observations from available functional genomics, proteomics, comparative genomics, and phenotypic data. The two strategies - the first using classifiers to map features to annotations, the second propagating annotations from characterized genes to uncharacterized genes along edges in a network constructed from the features - offer alternative and possibly complementary approaches to providing functional annotations. Here, we re-implement and evaluate these approaches and their combination for their ability to predict the proper functional annotations of genes in the MouseFunc data set. We show that, when controlling for the same set of input features, the network approach generally outperformed a naive Bayesian classifier approach, while their combination offers some improvement over either independently. We make our observations of predictive performance on the MouseFunc competition hold-out set, as well as on a ten-fold cross-validation of the MouseFunc data. Across all 1,339 annotated genes in the MouseFunc test set, the median predictive power was quite strong (median area under a receiver operating characteristic plot of 0.865 and average precision of 0.195), indicating that a mining-based strategy with existing data is a promising path towards discovering mammalian gene functions. As one product of this work, a high-confidence subset of the functional mouse gene network was produced - spanning >70% of mouse genes with >1.6 million associations - that is predictive of mouse (and therefore often human) gene function and functional associations. The network should be generally useful for mammalian gene functional analyses, such as for predicting interactions, inferring functional connections between genes and pathways, and prioritizing candidate genes. The network and all predictions are available on the worldwide web.},

abstract = {The KIR complex appears to be evolving rapidly in humans, and more than 50 different haplotypes have been described, ranging from four to 14 KIR loci. Previously it has been suggested that most KIR haplotypes consist of framework genes, present in all individuals, which bracket a variable number of other genes. We used a new technique to type 793 families from the United Kingdom and United States for both the presence/absence of all individual KIR genes as well as copy number and found that KIR haplotypes are even more complex. It is striking that all KIR loci are subject to copy number variation (CNV), including the so-called framework genes, but CNV is much more frequent in KIR B haplotypes than KIR A haplotypes. These two basic KIR haplotype groups, A and B, appear to be following different evolutionary trajectories. Despite the great diversity, there are 11 common haplotypes, derived by reciprocal recombination near KIR2DL4, which collectively account for 94% of KIR haplotypes determined in Caucasian samples. These haplotypes could be derived from combinations of just three centromeic and two telomeric motifs, simplifying disease analysis for these haplotypes. The remaining 6% of haplotypes displayed novel examples of expansion and contraction of numbers of loci. Conventional KIR typing misses much of this additional complexity, with important implications for studying the genetics of disease association with KIR that can now be explored by CNV analysis.},

abstract = {Background: Learning the function of genes is a major goal of computational genomics. Methods for inferring gene function have typically fallen into two categories: 'guilt-by-profiling', which exploits correlation between function and other gene characteristics; and 'guilt-by-association', which transfers function from one gene to another via biological relationships.Results: We have developed a strategy ('Funckenstein') that performs guilt-by-profiling and guilt-by-association and combines the results. Using a benchmark set of functional categories and input data for protein-coding genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Funckenstein was compared with a previous combined strategy. Subsequently, we applied Funckenstein to 2,455 Gene Ontology terms. In the process, we developed 2,455 guilt-by-profiling classifiers based on 8,848 gene characteristics and 12 functional linkage graphs based on 23 biological relationships.Conclusion: Funckenstein outperforms a previous combined strategy using a common benchmark dataset. The combination of 'guilt-by-profiling' and 'guilt-by-association' gave significant improvement over the component classifiers, showing the greatest synergy for the most specific functions. Performance was evaluated by cross-validation and by literature examination of the top-scoring novel predictions. These quantitative predictions should help prioritize experimental study of yeast gene functions.},

abstract = {The advent of high-throughput biology has catalyzed a remarkable improvement in our ability to identify new genes. A large fraction of newly discovered genes have an unknown functional role, particularly when they are specific to a particular lineage or organism. These genes, currently labeled "hypothetical," might support important biological cell functions and could potentially serve as targets for medical, diagnostic, or pharmacogenomic studies. An important challenge to the scientific community is to associate these newly predicted genes with a biological function that can be validated by experimental screens. In the absence of sequence or structural homology to known genes, we must rely on advanced biotechnological methods, such as DNA chips and protein-protein interaction screens as well as computational techniques to assign putative functions to these genes. In this article, we propose an effective methodology for combining biological evidence obtained in several high-throughput experimental screens and integrating this evidence in a way that provides consistent functional assignments to hypothetical genes. We use the visualization method of propagation diagrams to illustrate the flow of functional evidence that supports the functional assignments produced by the algorithm. Our results contain a number of predictions and furnish strong evidence that integration of functional information is indeed a promising direction for improving the accuracy and robustness of functional genomics.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem in human health is the inference of disease-causing genes, with important applications to diagnosis and treatment. Previous work in this direction relied on knowledge of multiple loci associated with the disease, or causal genes for similar diseases, which limited its applicability. Here we present a new approach to causal gene prediction that is based on integrating protein-protein interaction network data with gene expression data under a condition of interest. The latter are used to derive a set of disease-related genes which is assumed to be in close proximity in the network to the causal genes. Our method applies a set-cover-like heuristic to identify a small set of genes that best "cover" the disease-related genes. We perform comprehensive simulations to validate our method and test its robustness to noise. In addition, we validate our method on real gene expression data and on gene specific knockouts. Finally, we apply it to suggest possible genes that are involved in myasthenia gravis.},

We use microarray and genetic marker data from an F2 mouse intercross to examine the large-scale organization of the gene co-expression network in liver, and annotate several gene modules in terms of 22 physiological traits. We identify chromosomal loci (referred to as module quantitative trait loci, mQTL) that perturb the modules and describe a novel approach that integrates network properties with genetic marker information to model gene/trait relationships. Specifically, using the mQTL and the intramodular connectivity of a body weight-related module, we describe which factors determine the relationship between gene expression profiles and weight. Our approach results in the identification of genetic targets that influence gene modules (pathways) that are related to the clinical phenotypes of interest.},

The breakdown of $\beta$ cell-specific self-tolerance by T cells involves a number of dysregulated events intrinsic and extrinsic to T cells. Herein, we review the key mechanisms that drive $\beta$ cell autoimmunity, with an emphasis on events that influence the expansion and differentiation of pathogenic T cells in the periphery.},

abstract = {Optical imaging in the near-infrared (NIR) range enables detecting ligand-receptor interactions and enzymatic activity in vivo due to lower scattering and absorption of NIR photons in the tissue. We designed and tested prototype NIR fluorescent oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN) reporters that can sense transcription factor NF-kappaB p50 protein binding. The reporter duplexes included donor NIR Cy5.5 indodicarbocyanine fluorochrome linked to the 3' end of the first ODN and NIR acceptor fluorochromes (indodicarbocyanine Cy7 or, alternatively, a heptamethine cyanine IRDye 800CW) that were linked at the positions +8 and +12 to the complementary ODN that encoded p50 binding sites. Both Cy7 and 800CW fluorochromes were linked by using hydrophilic internucleoside phosphate linkers that enable interaction between the donor and the acceptor with no base-pairing interference. We observed efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) both in the case of Cy5.5-Cy7 and Cy5.5-800CW pairs of fluorochromes, which was sensitive to the relative position of the dyes. Higher FRET efficiency observed in the case of Cy5.5-Cy7 pair was due to a larger overlap between the ODN-linked Cy5.5 emission and Cy7 excitation spectra. Fluorescent mobility shift assay showed that the addition of human recombinant p50 to ODN duplexes resulted in p50 binding and measurable increase of Cy5.5 emission. In addition, p50 binding provided a concomitant protection of FRET effect from exonuclease-mediated hydrolysis. We conclude that NIR FRET effect can be potentially used for detecting protein-DNA interactions and that the feasibility of detection depends on FRET efficacy and relative fluorochrome positions within ODN binding sites.},

abstract = {Islet cell autoantibodies are strongly associated with the development of type 1 diabetes. The appearance of autoantibodies to one or several of the autoantigens-GAD65, IA-2, or insulin-signals an autoimmune pathogenesis of beta-cell killing. A beta-cell attack may be best reflected by the emergence of autoantibodies dependent on the genotype risk factors, isotype, and subtype of the autoantibodies as well as their epitope specificity. It is speculated that progression to beta-cell loss and clinical onset of type 1 diabetes is reflected in a developing pattern of epitope-specific autoantibodies. Although the appearance of autoantibodies does not follow a distinct pattern, the presence of multiple autoantibodies has the highest positive predictive value for type 1 diabetes. In the absence of reliable T-cell tests, dissection of autoantibody responses in subjects of genetic risk should prove useful in identifying triggers of islet autoimmunity by examining seroconversion and maturation of the autoantibody response that may mark time to onset of type 1 diabetes. The complexity of the disease process is exemplified by multiple clinical phenotypes, including autoimmune diabetes masquerading as type 2 diabetes in youth and adults. Autoantibodies may also provide prognostic information in clinically heterogeneous patient populations when examined longitudinally.},

abstract = {Genomic sequencing is no longer a novelty, but gene function annotation remains a key challenge in modern biology. A variety of functional genomics experimental techniques are available, from classic methods such as affinity precipitation to advanced high-throughput techniques such as gene expression microarrays. In the future, more disparate methods will be developed, further increasing the need for integrated computational analysis of data generated by these studies. We address this problem with MAGIC (Multisource Association of Genes by Integration of Clusters), a general framework that uses formal Bayesian reasoning to integrate heterogeneous types of high-throughput biological data (such as large-scale two-hybrid screens and multiple microarray analyses) for accurate gene function prediction. The system formally incorporates expert knowledge about relative accuracies of data sources to combine them within a normative framework. MAGIC provides a belief level with its output that allows the user to vary the stringency of predictions. We applied MAGIC to Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetic and physical interactions, microarray, and transcription factor binding sites data and assessed the biological relevance of gene groupings using Gene Ontology annotations produced by the Saccaromyces Genome Database. We found that by creating functional groupings based on heterogeneous data types, MAGIC improved accuracy of the groupings compared with microarray analysis alone. We describe several of the biological gene groupings identified.},

This report does not invalidate the 2006 recommendations on the use of plasma glucose measurements to diagnose diabetes.A WHO expert consultation was held from 28 to 30 March 2009 . . A systematic review was conducted on the use of HbA1c as a diagnostic test for diabetes mellitus. The evidence was summarized and its quality evaluated using the GRADE methodology. The recommendation was formulated and its strength was rated on a two-point scale, based on the quality of evidence and the applicability and performance of the method in different settings.The WHO Consultation concluded that HbA1c can be used as a diagnostic test for diabetes, provided that stringent quality assurance tests are in place and assays are standardised to criteria aligned to the international reference values, and there are no conditions present which preclude its accurate measurement.An HbA1c of 6.5% is recommended as the cut point for diagnosing diabetes. A value less than 6.5% does not exclude diabetes diagnosed using glucose tests. The expert group concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to make any formal recommendation on the interpretation of HbA1c levels below 6.5%.GRADE quality of evidence: moderateGRADE strength of recommendation: conditional},

\paragraph{CD4}
A protein found on a subset of T lymphocytes.

\paragraph{CD45RA}
The protein isoform lost on activation of naive CD4\positive and CD8\positive T cells.
It can be used to distinguish CD45RA high naive cells from CD45RA low memory cells.

\paragraph{CD127}
The alpha chain of the IL-7 receptor.
The IL-7 receptor is expressed on various cell types, including naive and memory T cells,
and usually expressed at higher levels on T effector and regulatory T cells.


\paragraph{CD25}
Better known as the \protein{IL2RA}, the alpha chain of the heterotrimeric IL-2 receptor.
High affinity binding of IL-2 requires all three chains of the receptor.

\paragraph{CD122}
The beta chain of the IL-2 receptor.

\paragraph{CD132}
The gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor.
